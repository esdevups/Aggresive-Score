If you don't understand that, fine, legitimate criticism, I'll write up ``three man cell`` and ``bounty hunter`` and then it will be easy to understand why ``ensured`` and ``insured`` are different - and why both differ from ``assured``.The sentence you quote is absolutely neutral.  You just aren't familiar with the underlying theory of strike-back (e.g. submarines as employed in nuclear warfare) guiding the insurance, nor likely the three man cell structure that kept the IRA from being broken by the British.  If that's my fault, fine, I can fix that to explain.  But ther'es nothing ``personal`` or ``creative`` about it.I'm tired of arguing with you.  Re: the other article, ``multi-party`` turns up plenty, and there is more use of ``mutually`` than ``mutual``.  If I were to apply your standard I'd be moving ``Mutual Assured Destruction`` to ``talk`` for not appealing to a Reagan voter's biases about its effectiveness, and for dropping the ``ly``.There is a double standard in your edits.  If it comes from some US history book, like ``peace movement`` or 'M.A.D.' as defined in 1950, you like it, even if the definition is totally useless in 2002 and only of historical interest.  If it makes any even-obvious connection or implication from the language chosen in multiple profession-specific terms, you consider it somehow non-neutral...  Gandhi thinks ``eye for an eye`` describes riots, death penalty, and war all at once, but you don't.  What do you know that Gandhi doesn't?Guess what:  reality is not neutral.  Current use of terms is slightly more controversial.  Neutrality requires negotiation, and some willingness to learn.This is your problem not mine.  You may dislike the writing, fine, that can be fixed.  But disregarding fundamental axioms of philosphy with names that recur in multiple phrases, or failing to make critical distinctions like 'insurance' versus 'assurance' versus 'ensurance' (which are made in one quote by an Air Force general in an in-context quote), is just a disservice to the reader.If someone comes here to research a topic like MAD, they want some context, beyond history.If this is a history book, fine, it's a history book.

0	`:: the term ``standard model`` is itself less NPOV than I think we'd prefer...:: if it's ``new-age speak`` then a lot of old-age people speak it - Karl Popper, the Pope, etc.  here's Karl Popper's view of this.:: The clearest title for this article would be ``particle physics cosmology`` - but as I say that would require broader treatment of issues like the Anthropic Principle, cognitive bias beyond the particle physics zoo, etc.:: as to accelerators, it's clear that while they are in use, someone is still looking for particles.  So this is not yet a settled ``cosmology`` so certain that we abandon the search... nor is it an arbitrary foundation ontology as you suggest, not subject to question.`

0	`:If you ever claimed in a Judaic studies program that ultra-Orthodox Jews don't have rabbis, or don't have synagogues, you would be laughed out of the room. ::I am beginning to see the problem you have. You see, you do not know how to read what other people say without attaching your personal bias to it. Never once did I say that ultra-Orthodox Jews have no rabbis or synagogues. I DID say that the role of the rabbi and synagogue in ultra-Orthodox Judaism is minimal when compared with, say, Conservative Judaism. They are not clergy, in the traditional Western sense of the word. That is a fact. As for synagogues, they exist, but they are not essential. Minyan (a quorum of ten adult males in ultra-Orthodox law) is essential. You can have a minyan without a synagogue, but a synagogue without a minyan is an empty building. You can laugh all you want, but it doesnt change the facts. It may seem strange to you, but take the statement to anyone who actually knows something. I want to know who laughs then. :If you ever claimed in a recognized Judaica studies program that a significant number of ultra-Orthodox rabbis accept and follow Modern Orthodox responsa (instead of their own), people would look at you as if you had two heads. ::Also a silly point. If you were to draw such sharp distinctions between ultra-Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism in a recognized Judaic Studies program, they would not know what you are talking about. A) That statement is false, because responsa in Orthodoxy does not work on the basis of someone's synagogue affiliation. B) What is a Modern Orthodox responsa versus an ultra-Orthodox responsa? C) In cases where things like hashgacha (kosher certification, etc.) are debated, you will find in most cases that it is not a question of responsa. If you know something about responsa literature in general (which apparently you do not), there are degrees of acceptance. For example, halav yisrael (milk under rabbinical supervision during milking to ensure that it comes from a cow). Most modern-Orthodox Jews do not insist on it t on the basis of a responsa by Rabbi Moshe Feinstein who determined that American government supervision is sufficient. Most ultra-Orthodox Jews do insist on it. They do not reject the responsa. In fact, Moshe Feinstein (Reb Moshe, as he was called) was considered the leading halachic authority for the American ultra-Orthodox community in the past fifty years. They will say that the ruling is right BUT they want to be machmir (more strict on themselves, meaning more pious). It is not a rejection. It is simply being stricter. Ovadya Yoseph said women could wear pants instead of skirts. Would any of his daughters or daughters-in-law be caught dead in pants? No way. They are machmir. :You just can't make this stuff up, Danny. ::I dunno. I seem to be giving answers to everything you say, and my answers are based on sources. I am not making things up. I am simply stating things that (no matter how inconceivable it may be) you do not know. :Stop trying to re-make the ultra-Orthodox in your own image. Its not good history. Frankly, I don't care what is on your resume. It doesn't justify writing such nonsense.  RK: Personal attacks. I will say that your intellectual arrogance coupled with your apparent ignorance do not put you in a very good light. In my professional life, I have researched and written extensively on this field, developed relationships  both working and personal  with many of the people involved, and worked on several important documentary films on the topic. I think I have a sense of what NPOV is, and a statement that the ultra-Orthodox ``hate`` the non-ultra-Orthodox just doesn't make the mark. : Is beating the shit out of non-Orthodox Jews an act of love? Is calling them ``worse than Hitler`` an act of love? Is accusing them of creating the Holocaust an act of tolerance? Danny, you can protest all you like, but you obviously so immersed in an ultra-Orthodox worldview that you can't see the forest for the trees. This is violent hatespeech, and it frightens me to see an educuated person making apologetics for it. RK:: Then it must frighten you even more knowing that I was actually there (and on one occasion, actually hit). Why? Because I do not feel the same antagonism that you do? Because I see some distasteful remarks in a certain context? You say in your diatribe that you want everyone to sit together and sing a Shlomo Carlebach niggun. Just answer me this though? Would Reb Shloime have davened in a shul without a mehitza? Oh, and haredi does not mean ``trembling,`` as you originally wrote at the top of the article. In fact, that was kind of funny.

I've tried to clarify this. ``Folk rock`` is used very specifically and is typically far more recognised by instrumentation than form. Many folk musicians of the 60s (Tom Paxton, Phil Ochs etc) sang new, topical material (which distinguished them from traditional folk musicians) but in the folk idiom (acoustic instruments, traditional arrangements and often traditional melodies.)Re: the comment about ``marketers`` in the first paragraph.

0	`Changed Macedonia link to Macedon; ancients didn't call their land Macedonia, and the entry we have on ``Macedonia`` isn't useful for Alexander. Should probably have an article on Macedon, and take the one sentence about Alexander out of Macedonia, maybe with a ``see also.`` I don't particularly have a problem with Macedon/Macedonia, but don't the naming conventions suggest that articles be named based on their most popular usage, rather than their most correct usage (if there's a difference)?  Perhaps using Macedonia to refer to recent history and Macedon for ancient history would work (with ``see also`` back and forth)?  BlainMy native language is Greek and I can assure you that Macedon and Macedonia is the same thing. Macedonia is the ``modern`` way to say Macedon. Maybe you should change back the link to Macedonia from Macedon. If the article about Macedonia is not informative enough you could always change it.Just a note about the relationship between Aristotle and Alexander. Those two were two different personalities and they used to clash a lot but Alexander did something that makes me wanter if their relationship was as bad as people think today. While he was invading Asia he would send to his teacher all new and interesting animals that he would incounter in his expedition because he knew that old Aristotle was almost obsessed with the classification of things. The result was that Aristotle formed a kind of a zoo back in Macedonia from the gifts of his student. Now, if young Alexander was so sick of his teacher why did he bother?  Good point.  I think Alexander was complicated enough that trying to determine who he liked and who he didn't (and which was safer) isn't all that easy.  He was known to treat his enemies rather well and to kill his friends when they ticked him off.  I think he might have respected Aristotle and just not wanted to spend time around him anymore.

I've visited evangelical churches that have nothing recognizably churchy about them - pure entertainment (movies, football games, mime, concerts, just about anything but rites or sermons) - and it's quite intentional; and I've heard that similar things are happening in trendy Roman catholic churches although I have no experience with that.

In those cases, it can be pointed out as emphatically as one would like, that ``the Old Testament of Jesus and of the Apostles, was the Greek Septuagint; and the reason that matters in this case is because the Septuagint was translated to say yada-yada, whereas the Hebrew version is more ambiguous.``   `

0	`I cut the following paragraph, which misleads people about biology::A few points are worth clarifying about ``nature`` and ``nurture``. First, ``nature`` does not reduce to anything as simple as ``present at birth``. Height is thought to depend very extensively on genetics, for example, but one is not born adult-sized; one must slowly grow up.The problem is clear in the example: height certainly does manifest itself over time as one ages.  But insofar as height has a ``natural`` component, it is' present at birth in the genome.  It is just that whatever genes code for height do not manifest themselves immediately.  But they are there at birth.The real problem with using height as an example of something that is ``nature`` but not immediately manifest at birth is that height is of course determined by ``nature`` and'' ``nurture,`` or, if you prefer, genes and environment.  this is the whole point of Boas's important studies on height; height is clearly highly heritable, but children of immigrants to the US had much higher average adult heights than their parents, presumably because of better nutrition in the US.I believe nature is best understood as things that are indeed innate (present at birth) as long as we recognize that things that are present at birth genetically may manifest themselves over time.  How else are we to distinguish a physical feature like height (that heritable part of it) from physical features like scars  which appear later in life and do mark the body noticably, but which are clearly not ``natural?`` `

0	Hi Mav, could you please look at the Irish Houses of Parliament. I put images to accompany my text on there. I know they are probably too big (I don't yet have the ability to shrink images yet -( ) but cropping them would cut off important bits of the image. Everyone seems very happy with the contents and images, but some browsers and screens may have problems due to their size. I trust you completely, having seen the standard of your work and would welcome any help you could give to make the images more screen-friendly. PS I hope no damage was done with that electrical storm. lol  22:59 May 10, 2003 (UTC)
0	Thanks for the response. I thought that it would be along the lines of your interests because we often work on similar scopes of articles. I wish that it were because you always contribute to scholarly articles, especially ones with a socio-economic and socio-political dimension lacking in so many others, like Industrial Revolution in its present form. I'd be really happy to see you do a little on accumulation, and I'd be very happy to integrate it with the rest of the text as well. That's exactly what the article needed anyway, namely an analysis of economic processes. 
0	: You're probably right about the modern Greek dictionary. I would extend the period under consideration to between the second century BC to the second century CE, so as to include usage at the time when the Septuagint was translated. But realistically speaking, it probably makes no difference at all to the usage of parthenos, or if it does matter a hair either way the references we have won't be that specific.

0	`Corrected a couple of things: Social welfare policies most certainly don't ``mostly date to the 1980s``. It's difficult to tie them to any perticular decade. There is not ``broad bipartisan support`` for the US alliance. There is broad support, yes, but also a long tradition of opposition. And the UK ties go back further and are still, perhaps, deeper. Then there is the trend to see Australia as part of Asia. And so on.

0	`  Heller is a good source.Concerning the ``Irgun`` versus ``Lehi`` question you raise, the confusion is resolved thus: when Stern broke away from the ``Irgun Zvai Leumi`` (National Military Organization) he named his new organization ````Irgun Zvai Leumi be-Yisrael`` (National Military Organization in Israel).  This is the ``Irgun`` in his letter.  It was only after Stern's death that the name ``Lohamei Herut Yisrael`` (Fighters for the Freedom of Israel) was adopted.`
0	===Deletion of a phrase ===Last week, a one-time Anon, 218.170.11.195 commented on the difference between the old and new census on the number of Taiwanese of Chinese ancestry:: The disparity in the numbers may be due to racism, the understanding in Han families that children belong to the man and the need by later governments to forge greater ethnic ties to China. [emphasis added]How does patriarchy play a role? Is it implying that Han fathers married aborginal women, whose children they had were claimed by the father and deemed by society to be father's only? This reason is not obvious and whose validity I cannot prove. It requires some elaborate explanations, but then, if so, it'd not fit in the basic intro of Taiwan. Perhaps in better fitted in Census of Taiwan or Demographics of Taiwan. And it requires serious rephrase.  22:20 17 Jun 2003 (UTC)

0	`Another thought - is describing the word as a ``neologism`` superfluous, perhaps? I've always been an advocate of approaching writing a Wikipedia article as if everything you're writing about happened a thousand years ago and is ancient history, because it seems to me that's the proper style for an encyclopaedia, which is intended to be timeless and authoritative. ``Neologism`` is an inescapably relative word - *all* words are neologisms looked at from one perspective in time, soon after they are invented. (All the words Shakespeare invented would be neologisms if you lived in 1630, for instance). I sincerely hope this page will be around in some form in another hundred years, at which point homophobia will no longer be a neologism. I think it's probably sufficient simply to say when and by whom the term was coined. Comments? `
0	`The problem with this page, IMHO, is that it doesn't deal with INDIGENOUS people at all, but rather (for lack of a better word) PRIMITIVE people.

As for those so-called ``indigenous people`` who have adopted modern ways, I'd make the argument that they're simply then no longer indigenous peoples (in the sense this article and the US uses the term, as misleading as it is).   05:52 25 Jun 2003 (UTC)`

When I shake my fist at someone on the freeway and call them an ``a__hole,`` I'm using figurative language (the figure of speech is synecdoche) without being poetic in any sense of the word.``In literal language, truth conditions work out well, while in figurative language, they may not.`` IMO the definition of terms in this sentence will be unclear to most general readers of an encyclopedia. What are ``truth conditions``? If it's a technical term, we'd better define it.Also, I moved the following to this page-== To add ==* Why would someone want to divide language into literal and figurative? What is gained thereby? (Lakoff provides some insight here.)* Why would people prefer not to view language with this divide?* How does this connect to theories of truth?``-These are all needed additions. The last one, especially, shows the importance and relevance of this subject to a broad range of disciplines, including theories of knowledge, cognition, language development, etc., etc.And now....here's an explanations for one of my suspect assertions -)``Some have boiled down the more than two hundred and fifty figures described in classical and traditional linguistics into two: metaphor and metonymy.``I know this from research, and my additions to Further Reading document reflect the ``classical and traditional`` end of this statement.

I know more about British geography than 99% of Americans - I remember in an online chat with some guy from Sheffield that he was surprised that I knew Sheffield was a city, as I was the first American he'd spoken to who had even heard of it. I think _you_ should enlighten yourself. You referred to a Google search that found most of the links to the name Exeter referring to the city in the UK. What proportion of those were from sites in the UK? If you can find even _one_ site anywhere that is put up by someone outside the UK that uses ``Exeter`` unqualified to refer to the one in England, and does not preface that with some reference to England, Britain, or the UK (to make it clear that he's talking about UK places!)

0	`The map availability theory is an interesting one, and worth considering. This whole thing dates to the early days of the ramblers, and the recreational interest in the landscape (as opposed to those too busy trying to live in it)On finding ley-lines, it took me a while to hunt it down, but this is a passage I remembered from John Crowley's excellent novel Ægypt: Star temples and ley-lines, UFOs and landscape giants, couldn't they see what was really, permanently astonishing was the human ability to keep finding these things? Let anyone looking for them be given a map of Pennsylvania or New Jersey or the Faraways, and he will find ``ley-lines``; let human beings look up long enough on starry nights and they will see faces staring down at them. That's the interesting thing, that's the subject: not why there are ley-lines, but why people find them...Actually I think the point of the statistical argument was that proponents quote extremely low probabilities that the alignments that they find could have arisen by chance: but out of the set of all possible alignments selected from (semi-)random points, there will be a number (perhaps a majority) of low probability ones.. ``Million to one chances turn up nine times out of ten``.   00:07 12 Jul 2003 (UTC)`

It is not that I deny it happened nor that it is relevant, but I believe it is ludicrous for to devote this much space to the incident in such a short article. I will try to research the matter and rewrite it in 1/3 the space, but personally I think it would be more useful to expand the section on his academic work, ie, Orientalism, which is much more interesting and important.   :In July 2000 Said travelled to Lebanon, where along with other Arabs he began hurling large rocks into Israel towards a group of Israeli soldiers.  Agence France Press released a photograph showing him during this attack. When asked about this event, Said told reporters that this was ``a symbolic gesture of joy``, and aimed at an empty place. Eyewitnesses claim that Said was lying; The London Daily Post reported that Said was observed hurling stones, in a group, at Israel soldiers in an Israeli watchtower.:Said was criticised for this action by the moderate Arab Press. A report in the Beirut Daily Star stated that they were disappointed that a scholar ``who has labored ... to dispel stereotypes about Arabs being 'violent'`` reversed couse, and let himself ``be swayed by a crowd into picking up a stone and lofting it across the international border.`` The student newspaper where he teaches, the Columbia Daily Spectator, commented that Said's ``hypocritical violent action`` was ``alien to this or any other institution of higher learning.`` :Several months later, in an interview with an Israeli newspaper (Haaretz English Edition, August 18, 2000) Said reversed his story, and denied his previous description. He now claims ``in fact what happened was that my son and some of the other young men were trying to see who could throw stones furthest. And since my son is a rather big fellow - he is an American who plays baseball - he threw furthest. My daughter said to me, 'Daddy can you throw a stone as far as Wadia?' and that of course stirred the usual kind of oedipal competition. So I picked up a stone and threw it.`` This latest revision is commonly held to be facetious.`

And militant Islamism (the militant Islamism of bin Laden, the Saudis, Saddam Hussein, the Baathists, and the Palestinian suicide bombers) or Islamofascism is the enemy of freedom and the distilled essence of evil. Totalitarian ideologies and fanaticisms have come in gone and have been defeated by America. All these ideologies are one in the same. They hate modernity, hate America, hate freedom, hate capitalism, hate liberal democracy, and love terrorism, oppression, genoicide, and fanatic hatred. In Germany the tyranical enemies of freedom and capitalism rallied behind Nazism, in Italy they rallied behind fascism, in Russia they rallied behind totalitarian socialism and communism, and now in the Middle East, where a lot of dictators and tyrants are threatened by freedom and American values, they rally behind militant Islamics. It is fact that there isnt a single Arab democracy. Muslim leaders (Saddam was just the worst of the lot. There will be more dictators/terrorists to fight like the Syrians) are all tyrants and terrorists who stifle the free press, kill their own people, crush their citizens hopes and dreams, and want to kill Americans like they did on 9/11. Their desire to kill Americans and supprot terror rests on one deep, abiding hatred: their irrational fear of America, which sticks up for freedom and opposes their tyranny with great scarafices, like America is doing right now defeating evil in the Arab countries of Iraq and Afghnaistan. The ideology of militant Islamist terrorism is the totalitarian enemy that America confronts today. And patriotic Americans say it will be defeated like America defeated totalitarianisms in the past through heroic struggle: Communism, fascism, Nazism. A lot of conservative commentators who speak with moral clarity call America's struggle against the evil of Islamofascist totalitarianism right now World War IV. That this is freedom's fourth struggle against a totalitarian evil. In WWI it was the despotic rule of the Kaiser, in WWII it was the Nazis, in freedom's third struggle it was the communists in the Cold War (although it wasnt a ``hot war`` it was another global stuggle like a world war). Now America's forth stuggle is a worldwide campaign against states like Iraq that hate the free world, kill their own people, desire weapons of mass destruction, and support terrorism. The antiwar liberal left appeases totalitarian evil, which they love to do. They rallied to defend the Communists in Vietnam. Now the amoral liberal left is opposing America's commander in chief George W Bush in his struggle in Iraq. Hundreds of millions were slaughtered (Communism murdered 100 million people while the liberals opposed the Cold War at every step) and Communism threatened the freedom of America and her allies. Conservatives say that America must stop this new totalitarian enemy before its murderous hate claims as many victims as Communism. `

Even while the neoliberals ofcourse want to put an equal sign between free market and privatization, very few privatizations are ever made that actually increases the competition in the market. Because if the buisness that is sold to private owners has a monopoly before it is sold, it ofcourse will to after it has been privatized. And if the company is sold while it is already subjected to competition it will to after it has been privatized. Indeed, privatization has nothing to do with ``free markets``, but is only a transferment of public property to private hands.

0	Axelrosen:I edited the technical analysis and charting page immediately after it had been merged.  Whoever did the job had linked remarks about technical with the EMH.  I then tried to make sense of what had been written.  In fact technical analysts don't talk about the EMH and woujld hardly know what it is.  It is for that reason that I wrote that they IMPLICITLY assumed (actaully without knowing it) weak form efficiency (or actually completely inefficient markets...that few people espouse belief in).  It would probably be wise to alter the text to disconnect the EMH comments from chartism as the practitioners do.King Brosby.
0	:Consider some recent actions: I helped exposed a Christian Identity neo-Nazi (and his close friend who always support him)...and not a single person believed me, even after massive amounts of incontrovertible proof were given.  Some people wrote me offline to tell me that they agreed with these statements...but none of these people were willing to agree with me on the WikiEn (Wiki-English) list. I am sad that people are so afraid of the Wikipedian group-think and smear campaign that they are unwilling to say certain things in public. Offline (i.e. in the real world), many people also agree with me on this issue. That is why they refuse to participate on Wikipedia. They think that I was nuts to participate here, because even in blatant cases of anti-semitism, the Wikipedia elite usually pretended otherwise, through self-deception, almost sterotypical pseudo-liberal stupidity, or by what we consider fairly clear examples of anti-Semitism.  :I was told, by a few professional colleagues in Jewish education, that their evalution of contributor comments led them to believe that the hostility to Jewish issues was so great that it would be impossible to talk to most people on Wikipedia about this. They warned me that if I tried to discuss these issues openly, I would be attacked as paranoid or a liar. And to my sorrow I learned that they were correct. That is why I stopped participating here.  :However, I am thinking about returning for a small number of articles, on topics that I already promised people that I would contribute to.  I had previously prepared some material to add on the Zohar and the Chosen people articles, and I don't want to leave these topics unfinihed, missing what I see as some crucial points, and what others have pointed out are obvious gaps in the articles.

0	It is perhaps dangerous to defend science using the sort of naïve methodology presently described in scientific method. That methodology is, at the least, dubious. Better to point out that science is grounded in a shared, and powerful, understanding that allows us to manipulate the world in ways that no other enterprise can. The debate between post modernists and empiricists (for want of better terms) is ongoing, and it is not appropriate to pretend here that it is finished. Better to simply refer the reader to the relevant articles.

The discussed lands were given to Poland supposedly to compensate for the eastern provinces annexed in 1939 and again in 1944 by Soviet Union. Poland was the country that suffered the most as the result of WW II, both from Nazi Germany and Soviet Union, therefore any comment hinting that Poland or Poles might be even partially responsible for any consequences of the War is absolutely unacceptable.# A mention of the Duchy of Swidnica, and it's ruler - Bolko's loyalty to Poland, would be nice.# More about the diversity in the region across the ages.# Autonomy of the Polish language speaking people during the Bohemian and Austrian rule, as opposed to the forced germanization after prussian takeover, through the ban of Polish (or Silesian) language, and oppression of the catholic faith - Kulturkampf, is worth mentioning. # Discrimination of the native Silesians by the Polish government, taking place both right after the war and now, is a must.

0	`I've found a misplaced reference showing that ``generatics`` did not start with me in content,only in name. The book, ``Learn from the Masters``, edited by Dwetz, Fauvel, Bekken, Johannsson,Katz (Mathematical Association of America, 1991), says on p. 286, ``It was not until 1894 that J.Tannery introduced the arithmetic of rationals as pairs [vectors] of integers.`` (Jules Tannery(1818-1910), French, is cited ONLINE.)In 1957, I received a grant from the National ScienceFoundation to organize the first NSF Workshop in Puerto Rico, planned for high math schoolteachers (some from States). I taught ``Foundations of Mathematics``. I was sent papers (laterlost) from previous Workshops. One set described Tannery's work and Hamilton's formulation ofcomplex numbers as pairs or vectors of reals. The formulator filled in by deriving integers frompairs or vectors of natural numbers. The latter shows how ``the law of signs`` derives fromCLOSURE on DEFINED DIFFERENCES (DDs) of naturals  (a - b), s.t. subtrahend is not greater thanminuend, hence, a natural number. Critical is multiplication law for DD. From standardmultiplication algorithm, find that, for DDs, (a - b) * (c - d) = (a*c + (-b)*(-d)) + (a*(-d) +(-b)*c). Applying, 10 = 5*2 = (9 - 4)*(2 - 0) = 18 + (-4)*(2) + 0 = 10, hence, (-4)*(2) must actas a subtrahend -8, leading to ``negative times positive equals negative`` rule. Applying productrule to 30 = 6*5 = (9 - 3) - (7 - 2) = (63 + (-3)*(-2)) - (18 + 21) = (63 - 39) + (-3)*(-2) =24 + x = 30, hence, x = 6 = (-3)*(-2), leading to ``negative times negative equals positive`` rule.This is forced by CLOSURE on DDs. However, in the ``Generating arithmetic`` article which Iinitiated, some one put in that CLOSURE is a concept from category theory, very advanceed math.Yet, the above book, on p. 260, says, ``For Galois (1830), Jordan (1870), and even in Klein's``Lectures on the Icosohedron`` (1884), groups were defined by the one axiom of closure. The otheraxioms were implicit in the context of their discussions  finite groups of transformations.`` SoCLOSURE goes back at least to 1830.Jonhays0`

0	`:::Serbs from Croatia ``cleansed`` themselves in the Operation Storm 1995, which is proven beyond reasonable doubt by orders from their commander (now an ICTY inmate) Milan Martic. And, this situation had been ``rehearsed`` several times from 1992 to 1995, as the repentant Milan Babic (another ex-rebel boss and ICTY indictee) has confessed. Nobody ``drove them out``. That's the fate they themselves had chosen. The central difference lies in the fact that no Croatian military units were involved in forced ``transportation`` or similar stuff. More: during ``Lightning`` and ``Storm`` operations, large-scale negotiations had been held with the representatives of Serbian military & civilian authorities in order to persuade them to stay. To no avail. The siren call of Greater Serbia was stronger. That's the Serb way. They either rule as a colonial minority ( parallels with the French in Algeria or the Portuguese in Mocambique are obvious ) or are out- out in Serbia. `

Nadis (the energy channels) and Qi energy are important concepts related to health, too.**Many people, mostly those who support Alternative medicine and mysticism, still believe that illness comes from within the body.**Chinese traditional medicine has some interesting views.**However, the views expressed by mystics and alternative medicine practitioners are not accepted by science.**For some alternative medicine examples, see Edward Bach and Bach flower remedies.**The role of subconsious mind in health is very important and emphasised in Mysticism.

0	`==Britain==:When the Romans took control of the largest island they called their possessions Britannia. The earlier celtic inhabitants became known as Britons and the island as Britain. Some centuries after the Romans had left, some of these Britons migrated to the near continent. About 1000 years later (i.e. by the late Middle Ages) the region they had moved to was known as Brittany, and to distinguish the island the term Great Britain was used (compare the French names Bretagne and Grande Bretagne). After the fall of the Roman Empire, the name largely fell into abeyance and tended to be used in an historical sense. Geoffrey of Monmouth used Britannia major and Britannia minor to refer to the island of Britain and Brittany respectively.Which name fell into abeyance - Great Britain? Geoffrey of monmouth comes before Roman departure + some centuries + 1000 years, so his use of Britannia major (= Great Britain) is the first use of it in the article, not a revival or historical use of a name ``in abeyance``.  `

It was an even split with the FCI, AKC and CKC grouping the types together and the ANKC, KC(UK) and NZKC listing the six types separately.  As the Dachshund page was already in place I decided not to mess with it for now.  We could eventually do the same as with Corgi - with a generic article at Dachshund and separate articles for each of the six types.  But my worry is that the articles would simply be too similar.::All this is just my opinion of course

Furthermore, your comments above don't seem any improvement to me on the language in the article now, which is very clear that republics come in many shapes and sizes (in fact, limiting them all to two so-called models seems more restrictive to me than it should be).  Use of the words ``genus`` and ``species``, as I've remarked to you before, is a misapplication of taxonomy to political science.  It may be useful for purposes of casual analogy, but we cannot resort to it in an encyclopedia article, or we will confuse and mislead our readers.  You have yet to demonstrate that any authority refers to a government such as that current in the United Kingdom as a republic.  As noted in this paragraph, Aristotle himself describes Sparta as a monarchy  one in which the monarch held weakened powers, yes, but fundamentally part of the ``monarchy`` category.  Your ideas have the merit of being an unusual take on republics which has given all of us cause to consider political terminology, but I am afraid your quotations, though well cited, do not appear to me to compel us to accept your two model theory of republics  it's original research, something Wikipedia is not.   `

0	=====John, I can't add to the Nazism and socialism talk page because it's not sectioned and too long for my browser.The point is that there is a debate on whether or not nazism is a form of socialism and the only way to write an article on the matter is to outline both sides of the debate. Taking out the competing debating points, in fact, makes the article NPOV by presenting the topic as if there is one right answer. And I'm sorry, it's just ahistorical to say that conservatives opposed Nazism. Some did, but most didn't, most notably von Papen. The Nazis didn't win an electoral majority. The only way they were able to take power was with support from the centre and right.

0	`Yeah, as I said, I didn't mean to intervene in the middle of your edits, and I'm sorry about that.  As to right and left wing, I agree the terms should be used with care.  But calling the Freikorps ``right wing`` and Lenin and the Communists ``left wing`` is not a particularly careless use of the terms, as far as I am aware.  If you can find a source that calls the Spartacists reactionary, or discusses the Freikorps as left liberals, I'd love to see it.  You'll note that I didn't reinsert the description of the Nazis themselves as right wing.  But I think that saying there are similarities between Nazism and Stalinism, say, is not to deny that Nazism is in some vague sense a movement ``of the right`` and Stalinism a movement ``of the left.``  At any rate, ``what was seen at the time as`` is an incredibly awkward phrasing - it's simply bad writing.  As to other changes, things like saying ``this is how the Nazis were different from other Socialists`` is completely POV, in that it says that the Nazis were socialists.  And you can't just cite laws as supporting a point without explaining them at all.  And it would be nice if you could actually cite scholars who discuss similarities between Nazism and socialism, rather than vague ``supporters`` of such arguments (at the very least, those opposed to such comparisons can cite ``the organized socialist movement`` rather easily, although I would agree that there are somewhat similar problems on that side of the debate.)  I also didn't revert many of your wording changes, because I think that some of them actually do do a good job of making the article less POV.  `

If you were to see the material of Zw's interest by Zw's contributions, it wouldn't confuse you in the slightest why Zw's acting this way.  I am uninterested in Zw's zealous pursuits along those subjective, topical lines.  It appears that Zw is confused in this respect, and if not, believes I am still to be held punishable for my contributions to Zw's interest-oriented articles, that Zw believes are errors without redemption for some reason.  I didn't know this would happen and didn't want it to happen, so as you can surmise, Anome, I didn't contribute to those articles with any malicious intent, especially in Zw's direction.  I didn't even know this Zw character existed until I was assaulted by Zw with some kind of Puritannical zeal.  I felt like I was on trial!  Regardless, this is not Zw's site!  I will not fight Zw for the usage of this site!

0	4/28/04: Tom Ruen here. I edited the IRV page today, added a second for special cases including rules to break ties. I'm not sure if it is appropriate for the level of article, but it definitely was a vital point missing from the existing article. That is, tie-breaking consideration is vital, but I also included optional rules for quickly eliminating many weak candidates on the first round. Some may object to this approach, although in reality it is very difficult for different elimination rules to affect the winner.You can always imagine examples where a weak first round candidate wins, but usually it takes core support AND Compromise appeal to win and few candidates survive merely on compromise appeal.Examples include:Round 1) A=38%, BD=29%, CD=16%, D=9%, ED=8%Round 2) A=38%, BD=29%, D=17%, CD=16%Round 3) A=38%, D=33%, BD=29%Round 4) D=62%, A=38%Here a 4th place, 9% supported candidate wins IRV on a cascade of transfer votes, always avoiding last place.Imagined elections like this are actually the biggest fear from people happy with plurality, that some voters can offer 2,3,4,5 votes to affect the winner while others only get 1 vote.The reality is that IRV retains the power of the two-party system to thrive because when there are 3 strong parties, voters can't safely vote for a favorite if that favorite isn't also likely to be ranked highly on votes supporting the candidate they hope to eliminate.First round rules that immediately eliminate a bunch of weak candidates at once help reduce fears that IRV helps weak parties.-

0	`Matthew Stannard, an expert of the English language, who constantly criticizes my use of English, interprets in his latest edit ``capable human`` as a ``human deemed to have the capabilities of humanity``. In what dictionary did you find such definition? The word ``capable`` has much more exact meaning, what is widely known to every educated person, in 1913 public domain Webster the first definition is ``Possessing legal power or capacity; as, a man capable of making a contract, or a will``. The capable person must have enough mental powers and ability to think to make a contract or will, what this means is legally very well determined what this means. Old people who are going to make a will are sometimes asked questions like who is the prime minister of his/her country, to find out whether he/she is mentally able, and carefully checked that every sentence is what he/she really wants. The other definition is ``Possessing adequate power; qualified; able; fully competent; as, a capable instructor; a capable judge; a mind capable of nice investigations``, but these are mostly the meanings for specific cases (like instructor or judge, not ordinary human). But not ``deemed to have the capabilities of humanity``.  `

0	`I was sad to see that you're going to be away for the next week, because as you're coming back, I will be leaving for the summer after that.  I want you to know that despite our disagreements, I really appreciate what you're trying to do.  It's difficult for most people to write a truly NPOV article, which is why what Wikipedia does is so great.  By having hundreds of thousands of authors, almost every point of view is represented, and people are forced to compromise, usually resulting in pure truth.  Unfortunately, the Holocaust is one of the few subjects where this doesn't work.  It is a subject which should be purely history.  The Nazis kept spectacular notes on everything that they did, and it should be spectacularly easy to say ``this here is exactly what happened.  We know, because of the monthly reports written by Himmler.``  Unfortunately, Holocaust deniers continually show up, most of whom have no interest in truth or even compromise.  They tend to wipe entire paragraphs, and replace them with their own propaganda.  This is just who they are.  They cannot provide evidence as convincing a page from Hitler's desk ordering the final solution to ``The Jewish Problem`` so they don't listen or compromise and eventually leave in a bad mood.At the same time, I can't exactly claim to be NPOV either.  It is fairly clear from what I have already written here that I hold Holocaust deniers in no high esteem.  Quite frankly, I find their so called ``beliefs`` to be an attack against me and my people.  It is, to me, like someone claiming there was never racial segregation in the United States, and that even if there was, the slave owners didn't know their slaves were being beaten.  It would be an absolutely ridiculous claim, and yet people get away with it in reference to the Jews.  It is good, therefore, that someone has shown up who is interested in this issue, but who has no real stake in the argument.  I would caution you, however, against being overly zealous in your changes.  Holocaust deniers are, by and large, anti-Semitic.  My personal favourite group believes that Jews are shape shifting lizards from Mars who are infiltrating the world governments in order to enslave humanity.  And yes, this group has a following.  The ``Holocaust Revisionist`` lines and the ``Jewish persecution was wrong`` lines are simply ways of attracting new followers who can then be trained to believe just about anything once they've got their foot in the door.  The people running these groups are solely occupied with promoting anti-Semitism in the hopes that some day they can finish off what Hitler started.  I encourage you to write carefully about what they believe, but please don't be fooled by them.I wish you the best of luck.   `

0	Romanian is very different from Dalmatian, so they probably developed in distant regions. This suggests that Romanians could not have come from the western part of the Balkans (including Albania). - I think that this argument should be entirely removed as it definitelly is not argument against theory of migration from south, but barely from Dalmatia (nobody claims that Vlachs arrived from Dalmatia). It is just irrelevant. On the same basis Dalamiatian could be replaced by Italian.

I have refereed papers for five mathematics journals, and my published papers have been refereed (and some unpublished ones that I submitted). Obviously history is consulted; obviously proof-checking is not the main point of refereeing; obviously novel ideas are examined in the context of accepted notions. To say that mathematics is not a science but a ``language`` ignores the fact that hundreds of journals are devoted to publishing new discoveries in mathematics. Obviously in judging publication-worthiness one considers how new discoveries may be relevant to potential future research; one considers esthetics (which for most mathematicians is the main motive for doing mathematics or for learning mathematics). Whence this loony idea that there is no need to consult history? Do you not see sections on how a new discovery fits into the historical development of the subject in many research papers in mathematics?Plautus satire's comments are those of a crackpot.  `

0	:I'd say you like Nintendo too much. ;):It's a good idea, now I think about it. I've been trying to think back to when bosses became popular (a mite difficult seeing as I would have been about five years old), and it seems that the flash point is in 1985.:However, I am quite heavily biased toward scrolling shooters, so I'm probably missing something important. Bosses are, on the other hand, probably more important in scrolling shooters than any other genre, because they have to break up the linearity of the game.:Anyway. In 1985, you've that Mario game thingy, and Gradius, which is the first time I can recall having to fight a huge boss character. Then in 1986 you've got Darius, which is the earliest game I know of that had different bosses for every level. I think it had minibosses too.:And then it really gets going. In 1987, I can name R-Type, Raiden, and Rainbow Islands as having distinct bosses, and by this point it was all pretty standard. But I'm just namedropping (and article-dropping too, seeing as I wrote most of those articles ;) ). The point is that there seems to be a dark age of bosses before 1985, so it would probably be interesting to unravel that.:The very earliest enemy-that-could-conceivably-be-thought-of-as-a-boss that I can think of (not including that Dungeons and Dragons thing mentioned in the article, which I know nothing about) is the Flag Ship from Gorf, an arcade game released in 1981, in the prime of the Space Invaders Era. Gorf was like five games in one, and when the player completed a level, they would move onto a level in the next game.:The fifth level was a battle with the Flag Ship. It has all the hallmarks of a boss: It's much bigger than the player's ship, much better armed, has its own forcefield, and is only minorly damaged by the player's weapon. The only way to destroy it is to hit it in its weak spot - a reactor situated deep within the ship.:Now I think about it, I don't know why I didn't mention this before. The thing is, I always thought of the Flag Ship as a 'level' rather than a boss. There wasn't really any concept of a boss at that point in history. Still, it's a start.

0	`== IPA - what ==I read the main page of the article on IPA.On the plus side it is clear.On the minus side, it makes no attempt to explain what the IPA is.  (context, scope, purpose, etc.)Nice chart.  Lots of data (for people who probably have no need of it) but virtually no general information.My questions (which weren't answered - keep in mind I'm a totally lay person):An alphabet is used to 1.  Communicate between a writer and a reader (of the same language), 2.  Describe that communication (unambigously?)  Right?Certain things are implied by its name, but clearly one should define what the subject of the alphabet is (are).  I have no idea if it covers all indoeuropean languages not to mention Mandarin Chinese (etc.)?Does it (attempt) to cover all spoken languages? Written?  What about non-vocal languages (finger snaps - all that stuff).  Sign-language?  We now have some evidence that hand gestures are linked to language in the brain...but I digress.  From a simplistic point of view language can be thought of as being three distinct (context sensitive) types of communication: written/read, spoken/heard and performed/viewed.  I suppose an alphabet can't cover the last (but see how choreographers describe dance) and, obviously, there are non-alphabetical languages (pictographics, heiroglyphic, etc.) just as there are languages which make use of whistles, clicks.  SO what does the IPA do?It just occured to me that maybe the IPA is (now-a-days) only used by euro-centric hobbyists and that would explain why there was no attention given to giving a serious explanation of what it is: ``if you have to ask...{then you don't need to know}```

0	* The article is not quite correct. Decoherence times can range from picoseconds to seconds, depending on the physical system used to implement quantum computer.

0	`:::I feel like you're making the mistake of assuming I'm an anarcho-capitalist. I'm not, particularly. Nor am I unaware that both Rand and the Libertarian party are wary of the label anarchist - just as wary as many left anarchists are of anarcho-capitalism. It's an uneasy relationship. The article should describe that. But the relationship is there - plenty of people accuse Rand of being an anarcho-capitalist, regardless of her denials of that fact, for instance. And plenty of people accuse the Libertarians of that. I mean, I think the umbrella label ``anarchism`` is a problematic one in a lot of ways - particularly in how so many groups simultaneously want to claim the label and avoid the label. I think the article needs to make the dissent and controversy surrounding the word itself clear. And any evidence I've offered in this debate should be taken as evidence of exactly how unclear the word is.  `

Also, I've seen ``Jerusalem Acres`` and if this is the headquarters of a 30,000 member group, then they have very little regard for, and very little per capita investment in, their headquarters, and this would certainly make them most atypical Pentecostals.

0	== The source of legislative authority ==The opening sentence is wrong. It saysIn the politics of the United Kingdom, legislative authority (that is, the power to make laws) is vested in Parliament . . . Incorrect. Legislative authority is vested in The Queen-in-Parliament, ie the participation of the monarch and the two houses. Unless the Queen Assents to a Bill, it cannot become law. In fact no monarch since Queen Anne with a Militia Bill in I think 1714 has declined to grant Assent. But Assent is still a legal requirement. Legislature authority exists only through The Queen-in-Parliament. Executive authority only exists through The Queen-in-Council with the cabinet exercising executive  power as a committee of the (Privy) Council. (That's why every minister must be a Rt.

0	`I disagree with the hard-and-fast division into ``English`` and ``non-English`` in the Billion and Trillion (which is too definite IMO) articles, (but agree the accepted Wikipedia value should be the US one). Here is why.My Collins English-German dictionary, third edition, purchased in England 1997, has this entry:Trillion n (Brit) Trillion f; (US) Billion f.Now the Trillion referred to is the German for 1 followed by 18 zeroes, and Billion is the German word for 1 followed by 12 zeroes.My few German acquaintances tell me they know this difference between the British and American (US) usage of ``Trillion``. Similarly for Billion. Also I did once hear an English-speaking person use ``milliard``, I had to ask them what it was! They (a well educated but non-British person) thought it was a common English word.My Cassell's English-Italian dictionary, admittedly an old 1985 edition, makes the same distinction in this way:Billion Bilione (English, 1,000,000,000,000; Amer. 1,000,000,000)Similar distinction for Trillion. Neither divides the usage into ``English`` and ``non-English``, speaking or otherwise.Admittedly current usage in the United Kingdom is either confusion or has adopted the American (US) usage. This has certainly been the case in the financial industry. I was taught the 'old' British usage of both terms in a school run by Americans in a British colony (helps to pass the British exams).The www.unc.edu link in Talk:Trillion above explains this, so I feel the articles should reflect this admittedly ambiguous difference. I tend to clarify when speaking English to well-educated non-British Europeans(who are aware of the problem with Billion and Trillion), as to exactly which I am using (``American`` or ``British``) to make it clear.Having said all that I'm not sure what's best: American and non-American; English and non-English; British and American (how the dictionaries usually give it); standard usage and non-standard?- |  11:06, 2004 Jul 21 (UTC)`

Is it still the ``worst`` to believe something that's true?: Additionally, I can turn your comment around and ask, why is it that YOU prefer to believe the ``best`` about Kerry. Credulity does not impress me as a hallmark of a good editor. Frankly, if you can't see the glowing pro-Kerry tone of the total article, you are not very perceptive.: Not only that, but the disputed sections: 'Medal-Toss' and '1971 VVAW MTG', in the forms they stand now, are extrremely tilted in favor of Kerry.

0	While you are correct that 'toughened glass' could be considered a misnomer (toughness has a specific meaning with regard to the strength of materials), tempering glass is not.  In fact there are two ways to temper glass to increase its strength: thermal and chemical.  Regarding thermal tempering, you are incorrect that the surface of a glass is in tension even at room temperature.  On initial cooling you are correct that the surface is in tension and the interior is in compression. However, below the glass transition temperature the stresses reverse and the surface is in compression and the interior is in tension increasing the strength of the glass.  Prince Rupert's drops are a laboratory curiousity demonstrating this phenomena.  If a drop of molten glass is cast into a container of water, it solidifies into a shape roughly resembling a tadpole.  You can bang on the big end with a hammer and the glass drop will not break.  However if you nip the tail, the drop disintegrates into dust usually with a pop.  Thermal tempering is usually applied to windshields.  Chemical tempering is usually accomplished by ion exchanging a smaller atom for a larger atom at the surface again putting the surface in compression. Although glazing and surface crystallization can also be used.  For example, soda-lime-silica glass can be placed into molten potassium nitrate and exchange potassium for sodium in the surface increasing the strength of the glass.  Thermal tempering can increase the strength of glass from 70 to 200 MPa while chemical tempering can increase it 500 to 700 MPa.  Chemical tempering is commonly used to increase the strength of beverage containers.

The reference site you gave me has good ones; I especially like the meat grinder for hash functions. John Savard's site looks like a wonderful resource - we should get him into Wikipedia! The M-209 looks like it could be a great challenge, but it'd likely require a lot more reference material than is readily available on Google. Ideally, I'd have a replica sitting next to me to model from; I'll peek around the web and see if I can turn up anything useful, though. If you know of any books I might find at the local library that would aid me, let me know.

Just as HRH The Prince of Wales may be referred to as ``HRH The Prince Charles, Duke of Rothesay,`` he may be referred to as ``HRH The Prince Charles, Prince of Wales.`` It is for this reason that I suggest adding ``Prince`` before the forename.   `

Another Nazi writer, Michael Freund, wrote that Napoleon was the only real revolutionist in 1848. Still another German National Socialist, K. H.

0	`Something I wanted to clarify about my last edit:I simply had a problem with the original post since it wasn't accurate. Gas chambers were specifically built for exterminating the groups mentioned in my edit. Jehova's witnesses and homosexuals were put into concentration camps, and surely mistreated beyond any measure conceivable to us. The fact remains though, that they presented a normal, and small portion, of those prisoner populations, and were not treated different than the rest of the prisoners. Jews, Sinti and Roma were people the Nazis specifically targetted for extermination as a people. Later on there wasn't even imprisonment for these people, they were simply transported to the death camps.A Jehova's witness could have saved its life by denouncing its community's faith and agreeing to be drafted to the Wehrmacht, a choice Jews didn't have. But this isn't my point and I'm not suggesting they should have done that.But the fact I want simply to put out by my edit, is:I've read about the Holocaust and the Euthanasia operation, I've read about the concentration and death camps, and the SS, Gestapo and SD ``security`` apparatus, but I didn't read about Homosexuals or Jehova's witnesses being specifically targetted for extermination by gas as distinct groups, maybe still as a part of the prisoner population, but not specifically. As a reference I want to suggest Eugen Kogons ``The SS state`` or the books of Raul Hilberg.`

0	`I'm a bit confused about this.  As I understand it, the Bohr compactification can be defined using either only Hausdorff compact groups (what some people simply refer to simply as compact groups) or quasi-compact groups (what some other people refer to simply as compact groups, unfortunately).  In the latter case, the homomorphism iota will be injective, thus iota(G) is a dense subgroup of H which is algebraically isomorphic to G, but carries a coarser topology in general.  I am not aware of a simple characterisation of those groups for which G is isomorphic to iota(G) as a topological group, but I'm sure there's a list of sufficient conditions around.I suppose that the usual construction of the Bohr compactification is something along the lines of ``the closure of the diagonal in the direct product of all compact groups in which G maps via a continuous homomorphism with dense image``?  That might be easy enough to include in the article, but so far I've not actually stumbled across an actual construction, except in the abelian case. `

I'd like to point another user to it, Dittaeva, who goes on major monosyllabic keep sprees from time to time.Also, sorry to bother you with this, but is there any reasonable way of accessing a VfD debate that is as old as Jan 2004? Anthony talked in the current Hubert Dreyfus debate about this being ``worse than when Sidney Morgenbesser was listed here and deleted.`` For a deleted article, Sidney Morgenbesser was surprisingly bluelinked, I thought, so I went look. Oh, my, what a terrible article. Consists of unpleasant anecdotes and fake references. The subject is a professor  with writer's block. Anyway, the point is, it was put up for deletion 23 Jan 2004, subsequently deleted, and then recreated in  August 2004 (as a stub, by Gzornenplatz.) Anthony added material to it on 15 August. So I wanted to put it up for speedy, but the relevant criterion says ``reposted content that was deleted according to Wikipedia deletion policy`` can be speedied, and how can I tell what the content was? The recreated article probably doesn't in fact technically speaking have the same content, since everybody called the old one ``vanity`` (there's a maybe incomplete record of the Januaray voting on User_talk:Anthony_DiPierro#Stop_the_vanity_insanity|this]] subpage of Anthony's), and the new one is much weirder than that. Oh, look, a learned cunt joke by Christopher Hitchens, how delightful.Anyway. I wanted to see the Jan voting for myself — Anthony doesn't claim that the copy of it  on  his page is complete — so I tried to burrow back through the huge VfD archive that was created in  May, but it broke when I was about halfway. So that was a wasted half-hour. -( There's got to be an easier way. Or maybe not?Anyway, good morning George. I shouldn't be doing this, I (despairingly) have other things to do. Urgent things. OK, today I'll  list Anthony's baby Sidney Morgenbesser for either speedy or VfD (yes, I will, if it's at all possible, i. e. if you have any answers for my questions above), and cleanup Reverse sexism and read that urgent dissertation chapter. Yep, those are the things I'll do. I just hope I don't get any more long screeds about vandalism and IP's and schools and stuff from sv.wiki, I can't afford to be everlastingly typing to those guys.  `

Hagelin was supported by large factions within the Reform Party, most prominently that Mangia fellow and Lenora Fulani, because of their (in my opinion, unwarranted, but that is irrelevant) desperation to avoid Pat Buchanan's nomination.  When I voted in Illinois, John Hagelin was listed on the ballot as Reform, whereas Buchanan was listed as Independent, because the state party refused to go along with (the larger of the two factions of) the national party and supported Hagelin.  The Hagelin faction made Mangia party chair, which can hardly be seen as an outside takeover, because he was already an officer of the party. -

I would say that the ``x effect`` is an abstract concept meaning ``the process by which e.g. squeezing a crystal creates electricity``, while ``x-electricity`` is a concrete thing, the electricity that you get as the result of the effect.  I think this means that the title of the article should be the ``x effect``, as you said above, but let's acknowledge the existence of the ``x-electricity`` form somewhere in each article.   `

If the Riemann hypothesis is hard to be (as appears to be the case), then wouldn't the short simple proof of A not using the Riemann hypothesis make the proof of A accessible to those who haven't worked through the proof of the Riemann hypothesis?

0	Ardent nationalism basically sums up every nation I can think of on the face of the planet at present.  It makes sense that a nation would extol the virtues of itself, right?  The PRC does not have a cult of personality, does not glorify male youth as fighters, does not glorify female youth as future incubators.  Mysticism is missing from official Chinese pronouncements too.  Also missing is the stated goal of said society.  Left Totalitarian regimes like China see a future where a hierarchy of work-production, and distribution can be overcome once production is more automated with robotics and technology and economic scarcity can be overcome.  Allowing private property is a means towards an end in the case of China (market socialism).  Right Totalitarian regimes see hierarchy as the natural and permanent order of things, and the existence of private property is not a mean to an end, but the end to be preserved within itself.  A broad definition of fascism which would more correctly have to be termed corporatism if we say that mysticism, gender roles, and ideological heritage/stated aims aren't necessary conditions, then that would also allow us to place countries like the U.S since the 1930's, social-democratic Germany, and Keynesian Japan in that category.The main difference between fascism and capitalist-democratic or more benign corporatist states is the right for trade unions and combinations to engage in collective bargaining and even work stopages (strikes) against the immediate consent of the state or business.  Unions have this right in China today, to a limited extent, as in the U.S to a limited extent.  On an economic basis, Germany may be considered more corporatist or economically interventionist than the U.S, but politically the citizens have more rights to protest and engage in collective bargaining or form new unions.Unless I can be swayed from this line of thought, and I am open to it, I will mercilessly edit out grouping the PRC as fascist.

Of course, in a technically accurate sense either word would work, but we would then be blind to the inherent emotional connotations in each example.  To gay activists, ``disruptive`` is connotating disapproval with the decision, as we normally use ``disruptive`` in a negative sense.  Important, to people with more traditional values who view marriage as necessarily between a man and a woman, improperly connotates a sense of approval and puts the decision in a positive light.  It is not only the content but the form of the message that is able to contain POV.  `

0	Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a dictionary, but that's besides the point.I agree: the element phosphorus is bound to be looked up more often than Phosphorus meaning Venus and so that article should take priority (in terms of where the user is taken when they search). However, Wikipedia is not designed to be used purely by Wikipedia editors or those clued up with its conventions (nor those willing to take the time to discover them), but by anybody who wants quick and helpful access to a topic. Is such a person likely to expect to find a footnote at the bottom of the element article - I certainly don't think so. I would have thought such a person would give up at that point and look elsewhere. I don't think such a person would expect the topic they're searching for to be a footnote to something entirely different. However, if the 'dab' (is that an official term?) is at the top of this article, this certainly isn't a problem.I think it's poor practice - even if it is a general practice - to place disambiguation notices (I don't see why their 'significance' is a factor; either they're so insignificant they don't merit an article, or they do and hence shouldn't be hidden away) at the bottom of articles, since this makes the task of the user so much harder, whereas surely an encyclopedia should strive to make access to information as easy as possible.How relevant the links to the page are I'm unsure: I would have thought many people access information by entering search terms, rather than coming from a different page, and so will not have the clarification of the article's name you seem to imply.

Tyler certainly does have a ethos and creed, where as a nihilist does not. His creed can certainly be said to be destruction of the current culture and certainly retrograde in many respects, seeking to return to a simpler subsistence level of existence (i.e. hunter/gatherer) but he definitely has an established ethos and world-view. It is simply contrary to much of modern society. I posit that the edit should be reverted back to anarchist.  ==Reader's Digest, Jack/Joe==Hey, a few years ago I was reading a really old Reader's Digest and I swear I actually read an article written first person from an organ's point of view.  (I don't remember which.)...and the guy's name was Joe.This was before I read the book, so I just thought it was a really odd coincidence at the time...I can't seem to find the article anymore, though.  Does anyone else have any info on this?  Was Joe changed to Jack to avoid legal troubles with the original ``Joe's XXXXXX`` author?: The author of the book was talking about real stories from Reader's Digest, so you probably did read the same ones he refered to. ``Joe`` is changed to ``Jack`` in the movie because Reader's Digest wasn't willing to allow them to mention it in the film.  ::I have a copy of John Pekkanen's article ``I am John's Brain Tumour``, from Reader's Digest (South Africa) 1990-12, volume 137, number 824.

The English RD sites I searched came up empty. The earliet ``Joe``s I found were two 1974 videos  from ``Pyramid Films``. I found that ``Pyramid Media`` credits it to RD . Does anyone have a source of an actual Reader's Digest article with ``Joe``? - , 2004-04-15t22:37z::: It is mentioned on the commentary for the DVD that Reader's Digest told them not to use ``Joe``. Apperantely they own the copyright somehow. Either way, the narrator in the book does use Joe rather than Jack. And given that the book is the original story, I believe that ``Joe`` should be used more often in the article than ``Jack`` (though ``the narrator`` fits the character's ``name`` more accurately). The article seems to lean too much towards being about the movie, which makes it seem as if it was the original source material instead of the book. It would be best that we keep the article based mainly on the book, with details on the movie where applicable. Otherwise, what we would be doing would be the equivelent of someone making the Lord of the Rings article more about the Peter Jackson movie than JRR Tolkien's work.  ==Tyler section==We should merge the Tyler Durden section into the characters section. There isn't a need for 2 separate sections on him. As it is it looks redundant and a bit sloppy. Any details that don't fit that section can go into a different one.  ==Backstory of the novel==I just recently updated the article on Chuck Palahniuk with info on how Fight Club came to be. This is in the first paragraph of the Biography section. I was wondering if anyone thought we should include that info in this article, since it gives the backstory of how it was written.   ]] ==Musical==This this for real?

Also a recent Guardian interview.   ==Movie & Book Balance==As I mentioned above at the end of the Reader's Digest, Jack/Joe section, the article is ``biased`` towards the movie (that is, the info for the film is treated as being the primary source instead of the book), and needs to be balanced equally for the book. I have fixed a recent re-write of the plot section (which made it even more biased in favor of the film), but more work could be done to balance the article.

While you may consider the book POV it is generally accepted among scholars as being authoritative. Can you see that is what allows it and material covered in it to be included in a reference work. The relevations of Khrushchev and Solzhenitsyn are also generally considered to be significant. You seem to feel that simply casting unverified aspersions on a source is sufficient to support exclusion of the material from Wikipedia. Don't you see that simply saying bad things doesn't change the underlying general acceptance by scholars of the material? As to Conquest's representations being exposed, it is generally accepted that in the main they were affirmed.Simply labeling something POV does not justify its removal from a referance work which has a NPOV policy which contemplates inclusion of multiple points of view, see Wikipedia:Neutral point of view. Can't you see that inclusion of your point of view is dependant on allowing other points of view to also be included?LIkewise describing the point of view of revisionist scholars of communism is simply a description of a tendency of scholars of a certain school of communist scholarship  and is backed up by a specific reference which dicusses the subject at length.

0	The comment that modern languages use zero-indexing is somewhat misleading, because it isn't because of technical merits, but because of the popularity of C. It's no problem for the compiler to convert the one-indexing preferred by humans (or indeed most any indexing) to the zero-indexing used in the machine code. However, since C used zero-indexing and became so popular, most programmers are used to it. That's probably the reason it's used in most later languages.

After beavering away at the change in categories I think I upset one of the people looking after the psychology category who went through redoing their categories. It would be nice if we could work together on this project to achieve a sort of mini psych textbook. I think that would also help those who currently take a rather oppositional approach to find that we don't have three heads and aren't out to harm them. I can already see some of this mollification occurring with some contributors. Still my bias is to add to the clinical psychiatric area since this is my field.

That dialect is certainly Macedonian in the geographical sense of the word. However, if we take modern Bulgarian and Macedonian as a starting-point, the dialect has many more traits of Bulgarian than of Macedonian.You seem also to forget that it is politics that defines what is a language and what is a dialect and which dialects belong to a certain language, not vice versa. As regards the Slavic dialects of Macedonia, we have an almost universal acceptance of them as Bulgarian until 1918, then they become viewed as Serbian by most scholars, and we have actually started regarding the name ``Macedonian`` as a linguistic and not only geographical term since 1945. Quoting the synchronical aspects of a question is of not much of a use when you lack any knowledge about its diachronical development. `

0	== Parentacide ==Parentacide is the term used to describe a child killing one or both parents. Although the subject is as abhorrent as suicide or infantecide, it is a part of our life that cannot be dismissed.Parentacide dates back to Greek mythology, where Oedipus killed his father Laius and married his mother Jocasta. Frued coined the term Oedipus complex to describe a state of psychosexual development and awareness first occuring at the age of 3 1/2 years.In 1989 Lyle and Erik Menendez commited parentacide when they murdered both of their parents in cold blood. Although the murders were at least partially motivated by money, the brothers alleged their father had abused them, which was their justification for the killing.Jeremy Bamber committed parentacide by proxy and was convicted in 1986 of killing his adoptive parents, sister, and her two six year old sons. Although money was thought to be the motive for this killing spree, the fact that he was adopted indicates that the reasons behind the murders were less clear cut. Being adopted, Bamber very likely suffered from adopted child syndrome, which is a psychological maladjustment to the knowledge that his real parents had given him up for adoption.

0	== Middle Chinese Influence ==I was wondering what is the V+ and the V- in Middle Chinese mean or where it came from.  I have done research on Minnan hua and they don't seem to always map to Cantonese in a few tones, perhaps they are confused by the different tones.  In some ways, I think Vietnamese is even closer to Cantonese than Minnan in terms of tones.  It almost maps to each one exactly.  The 2nd tone in Cantonese usually has the ? accent in Vietnamese and the 5th tone always have the ~ tone on top of the vowel.Also, Vietnamese preserved some of the NG initials that seem to be dropped from Cantonese, eg.  ren2 (mandarin) ->  jan4(cantonese), but it has the ng inital in Hakka, Toisanese, and Vietnamese.Cantonese doesn't distinguish between teacher/lion and poem.hakka/viet su  (sai in minnan i think) teacher/lion and   si  poemBut there's closer tongue curling relationship between Vietnamese and Mandarin.  (Possible tongue curling in older Chinese?  or Manchu influence?)shi  goes to th, suand all si go to t or szh goes to  chi, trz  goes to t or tychi goes to xi, tr, si   (no real pattern)c   usually t  but some exceptions to tu or thuAlso, it seems that most (if not all) 2nd tone x, zhi, z initials in Mandarin has a hard ending (-k -p -t) in Cantonese.The hard endings -k -p -t is an element from older Chinese.  -h also in Minnan.

0	:The idea behind the nicotine patch is to deliver sufficient nicotine to your bloodstream to help alleviate physical withdrawal symptoms.  You won't get the same spikes in your nicotine level that you get with cigarettes, but you shouldn't have major physical withdrawal symptoms.  With the patch, the hardest part is getting over the habitual and psychological addiction of nicotine.  :Most of the patch systems allow the user to step down around week 6, going from 21mg/day to 14mg/day to 7mg/day.  Tapering the dose like this should allow for a smooth landing when you're done smoking and make physical withdrawal symptoms unlikely.  Dreams are a relatively common side effect from the patch, at least from me.

This reads like an old article from The Children's Encyclopedia, but I don't know if that's where it came from:Piccadilly Circus is the centre of London where many streets meet. In the middle of the Piccadilly there is a small island of stone, and on the island there is a statue called Eros. Eros holds a bow and arrow, and leans forward as if he is flying over London.On the steps below him women used to sit with baskets of violets and snowdrops, or bunches of pink carnations and tight little rosebuds.All around are buses and lorries, and taxis and cars coming from north and south and east and west.Day and night the busy London traffic swirls round the small, stone island, and day after day people hurry past on their way to shops and theatres and staions and offices.Everyone knowws Eros. Taxi drivers look up at him and say,``Ah,Eros!Here we are at Piccadilly!``CHildren, holding tightly to their mothers' hands as they cross the road, try to catch a gimpse of him between the rows of traffic. But no one seems to have time to go up the steps, and read the words that are written below the statue.

0	`== Condoleezza Rice censorship ==Hello Jewbacca. I am writing to inform you that I have some issues with your edits to my contribution to the Condoleezza Rice article. Although you claim that I ``poison the well with unneeded POV implications,`` I would argue that your ambitious language leaves too much open for interpretation and lets Dr. Rice off the hook. Having a NPOV doesn't mean censoring controversial ideas. For example, you removed ``criticized`` from the line ``Rice became the first National Security Advisor to campaign for her boss...`` You make it sound like perhaps it is a good thing that She was out stumping for Bush instead of protecting the homeland. In addition, you removed another line I added that spelt out that there is a ``controversial`` link she perpetuates between Iraq and September 11th. The fact that this is even open for interpretation is beyond me. I believe my additions were in line with the NPOV policy and I have replaced them. It concludes with the actual quote so readers can pose their own stance. I am open to suggestions of maybe a better way to word my feelings on this topic. Please let me know.  `

When we have the Homeopathy article explaining every single concept and aspect of homeopathy, except for only two short and simple definitions explained somewhere else, both of which can be written as single paragraphs, which are both referenced only in one paragraph of the main Homeopathy article, then it seems rather obvious that those paragraphs should be included in the main article itself. Note that besides the List of homeopathic remedies there are only two articles with “homeopathic” in the title: Homeopathic repertory and Homeopathic proving. Every other concept is explained in Homeopathy. Their what links here pages show that they are needed for only one purpose: to explain one paragraph of Homeopathy article, the first paragraph of Homeopathic remedies section.

At the first read, I immediatly got the impression that the article was written by a fan, and that the text didn't flow as well as it could because too much detail and too many quotes of more or less relavancy were included in the narative.  You seem to resist the editing of the article by others, reverting the article atleast 6 times in the last two hours.  This is not constructive.  If others choose to edit an article, it is because they want to make the article better, either by adding more detail, or by making the existing detail easier to find or understand.  We're all here to build a better encyclopedia, and sometimes a better encyclopedia is built by tightening up content so that it is presented in a clearer, more consise manner.  The best content in the world is of no value to anyone if the reader never finds it because it is surrounded by too much fluff.

As for the implication that I might simply be lying about this - why would I want to do that? These places are not the only examples - a tour of the area on foot will confirm what I'm suggesting. As for the CCTV info, it may be true, but it isn't actually very interesting, nor is it worded in a way which makes much sense. Read the sentence again - it does not tell you anything unless you already know what it's meant to be saying. If it can be reworded to say something interesting it might be worth keeping. (Since the UK now seems to be infested with surveillance systems, I don't think that singling Hemel out is really worth a mention). 
0	`:Let me explain the problems in your paragraph, which for ease of reference I include below.::Prime Minister Blair is known in Britain as well as the United States for his personal closeness to US President Bush. The two's coordination is uncanny, rarely ever voicing direct disagreements and presenting united stances on most issues; sometimes with Blair going against the Labour party as well as the majority of British citizens. In May, he backed the controversial Israeli withdrawal plan for the Gaza Strip, a radical departure from traditional British politics toward the region, and a move that put the British government in the position of being the only major nation besides the US to support it. He acquiesced to American requests in October to send Scotland's prestigious Black Watch battalion to Baghdad. Recently, the Prime Minister responded to a question on the environment with a stance very close to what the President Bush's was. This ``special relationship`` between George W. Bush and Tony Blair has drawn a mixed bag of reactions in the UK, but it continues to be strong. In November 2004, the Prime Minister travelled to Washington in hopes of using the close friendship to influence the President's stances on a European summit, environment/climate control, and an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan.:The first sentence is acceptable and is in the article. The second is where the problems start. ``The two's coordination is uncanny`` is the sort of statement one would make about two lovers, and will carry this meaning to readers. As for ``rarely ever voicing direct disagreements``, you will find this in most public utterances in diplomacy, regardless of any actual disagreements. For example read the press conference with Blair and Chirac earlier this month. The issue of dissent within the Labour Party over Blair has already been covered in the article and needs no repeating here.:The UK government's support for the Gaza withdrawal plan is hardly ``a radical departure`` and, even if it was such a statement would be POV. See 'The Chariot of Israel' by Harold Wilson for the full story of British support for Israel over the years to 1981. Also, the Israeli Labour Party has supported it, and that carries weight in its British sister party. Then the use of the term 'acquiesced' which is only used in a subservient relationship and is therefore pejorative, as is the insertion of 'prestigious' before the regiment: this reads as if it magnifies any offence because the regiment involved was more distinguished than others. :The remark about the environment lacks any detail but is irrelevant: the UK government policy hasn't changed and is quite distinct from the US, so anything which Blair might have said at a press conference is neither here nor there. Finally we come to a report of Blair's visit to the US which states that it was about the environment (it wasn't - see press conference) and is imprecise. This issue, and the rest of this edit, is better covered in the article as it was, and I have therefore reverted it.  `

0	`==Video Poker==Video Poker machine payout tables only represent a theoretical payout percentage. The vast majority of gamers cannot achieve that payout percentage because they do not play correctly.It is essential to draw correctly depending on the content of each dealt hand, and there are strategy tables devised by computer which determine how to do so, depending on the payout table. (Hence you need different strategy tables for different payout tables!)My ambition is to add such strategy tables to the Video Poker article, but I can't just copy-and-paste such strategies from an existing book due to copyright. To get around that problem, I have an off-the-shelf analytical program that allows the creation of strategy tables based on a weighting of difficulty vs. accuracy. These tables are slightly different than the published ones, but still accomplish the desired positive payoff.If you're interested in getting a good feel for this, there is a training program called ``WinPoker`` available from Zamzow Software, (in the U.S.), that allows you to practice, as well as automatically run through a great number of hands using a given payout table and strategy.Cheers, `

But Operation Peace for Galilee ended in failure.`` :``Israel launched operation ``Peace for Galilee`` and invaded Lebanon in 1982 in what was sold to the Israeli public as a bid to drive the Palestine Liberation Organization back from the northern border. Sharon went on to drive the PLO out of Lebanon and to try to install a more friendly regime there. ... The Israelis stayed, and their effort to install a new regime ended in disaster.`` * The Invasion was planned:``When, in early June 1982, terrorists of the Abu Nidal organization, a PLO splinter group, badly wounded the Israeli ambassador in London during an assassination attempt, Israel seized the pretext for launching its long-planned offensive.`` * The Invasion was opposed by the US and the UN::* See ``U.N. Security Council Resolution 509``:*``On June 6, President Reagan, in France to meet with the G-7 Heads of Government at the Versailles Economic Summit, dispatched Habib to Israel to try to restore the cease-fire. That same day the United States joined a unanimous U.N. Security Council Resolution demanding that Israel withdraw from Lebanon and that the border cease-fire be observed by all parties.`` * Other details::``September 15, 1982: Ariel Sharon arrives in Beirut to personally direct the IDF campaign ...

However, many women, and entire families as well, ran away from the camps to the north. I went back and repeated my report over and over. Each time, however, the answer was the same: ``It is okay.``...It was possible to stop the massacre in Shatila, even on Thursday; had they acted on what we reported to our commander.

Shortly before the event, the board of directors vetoed our admission as exhibitors.  Word of our attendance had spread to a minority of Jewish women in the organization who objected to our very presence.TAB_TOKENNOCIRC has exhibited successfully at literally hundreds of conferences locally, regionally, and nationally.  We are asked back year after year.  Without religious prejudice, we provide information about the traumatic effects of circumcision.  We hand out our information pamphlets in a non-confrontational manner to those who approach our table because they are interested in learning about the issue.  Each year, we have a well-received exhibit booth for physicians attending the American Academy of Pediatrics national conference.TAB_TOKENNOCIRC already counts among its supporters hundreds of LLL members and former members.  The silent majority of leaders within League are already on our side.    Attendees who were interested would have  appreciated our information; those who were not interested would have just walked on by.TAB_TOKENThe vast majority of boys who are circumcised in the United States are not sons of Jewish or Muslim parents.  Preventing these non-religious circumcisions has always been the primary focus for NOCIRC.  This painful surgery, the most common procedure that baby boys are forced to experience, puts breastfeeding success at risk.  Good chest-to-chest positioning requires mom to press her son’s wounded penis up against her body, and the pain makes him unable or unwilling to nurse.TAB_TOKENLa Leche League reported problems with breastfeeding by circumcised infants in their 1981 edition of The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.  In 1996, LLL ratified the Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative, along with 25 other organizations.  The organization accepted ten basic principles for mother-friendly care,  including the requirement that service providers must “discourage non-religious circumcision of the newborn.” (on-line at ).TAB_TOKENThe breastfeeding relationship does not begin in a vacuum.  In 2002, NOCIRC issued its position statement, “The Effects of Circumcision on Breastfeeding,” available at .  Researchers have found that some male babies are unable to suckle the mother’s breast after circumcision.  The circumcised infant is in pain and is in an exhausted, weakened, and debilitated condition.  The circumcision procedure frequently causes the newborn to withdraw from his environment, interfering with his process of bonding and breastfeeding.TAB_TOKENLa Leche League claims it is a non-sectarian organization.  However, when it comes to circumcision, it is a religious organization.  A few powerful members are keeping clinical data regarding breastfeeding obstacles out of the hands of all members in order to further their personal religious viewpoint.  For six years now they have systematically excluded NOCIRC from simply having a table at their area and national conferences.TAB_TOKENThe Board of Directors has placed a higher priority on protecting religious circumcision than on breastfeeding success for the 94% of non-Jewish, non-Muslim  moms.  Jewish boys have seven days to establish breastfeeding before undergoing surgery; non-Jewish boys do not because they are circumcised at birth, and thus they are at a greater risk.TAB_TOKENThe Board’s action is hypocritical in light of LLL’s own struggle with those who block the promotion of breastfeeding benefits for fear of upsetting parents.  LLL has itself been accused of producing guilt when they describe the advantages of breastfeeding in much the same way that NOCIRC is now being accused by LLL.TAB_TOKENLLL has an obligation to its members to make available information on how circumcision affects breastfeeding.  New and expectant moms need this information ASAP in order to nurture a successful breastfeeding relationship with their sons.  NOCIRC can help to insure that this happens.T

0	`== WikiProject Wiki Syntax ==Good morning.  Thank you for helping to clean up the Wikisyntax.  I was not aware of that effort until I saw some of your edits.  I do, however, have to disagree with some of the minor changes you've been making in a couple of paragraphs where the author/editor has chosen to itemize his/her arguments.  For example, at Bee learning and communication, someone wrote ``The primary lines of evidence used by the odor plume advocates are 1) clinical experiments with odorless sugar sources which show that worker bees are unable to recruit to those sources and 2) logical difficulties of a small-scale dance...``   You changed those to ``(1)...`` and ``(2)...``. This may be a small point, but I believe it is stylistically incorrect. Surrounding the number on both sides generally indicates a footnote, not a segmented argument.I'm guessing that this is going to create some false positives on the automated list of possible syntax errors but I'm going to revert those changes.  I've made a comment on the project's Talk page about the problem as I see it.  Thanks.    `

0	`::::::::You incorrectly infer from the agreement to include other pictures that all editors have agreed to delete the photo you propose to delete. There was no consensus to delete the photo. There was your demand that that the photo was unrepresentative and there were other editors acting to find photos to assuage your demands by providing other photos that would meet your demands. That doesn't imply agreement with your demand to delete a factual photo. It is not an explicit expression of consensus.

The picture of the Wall that you want to delete is very significant. It shows the ugliness of the Israeli wall. There is no rule that says photos must be representative. A photo is a factual representation of the facts. This is aone part of the wall. Deleting it is a form of cesorship of the reality of the Wall in at least some places. In any case, how is representativeness determined? Your opinion does not suffice. What percentage of the wall is fence and what percent is wall? What is the representative appearance in populated areas? What is considered a representative portion? What are the future final plans for the wall's appearance?

0	`::::::There is nothing inherently POV about discussing Israeli violence against Palestinian children. It is a fact. It is a recognized problem as the data in the article reflects.  We don't balance articles about Nazi concentration camps by renaming it ``Violence in the Nazi-Jewish conflict`` and then inserting sections about Jewish uprisings against the Nazis in order to deflect attention from Nazi atrocities and paint the deaths of oppressed Jews and oppressing Nazis as if they are equivalent.   That is what the WikiZionists intend to do. They want to rename this article to something ``neutral`` (i.e. something that doesn't reflect the facts about Israeli atrocities against Palestinian children) and then pad it with sensationalized Zionist POV sections about Palestinian resistance to Zionist aggression. They already have plenty of Zionist POV articles smearing all palestinians as fanatic terrorists rather than victims of Zionist terrorism.

0	`§ I got in touch with the owner of the website mentioned above, and he has offered to e-mail me a scanned copy of the map in the book illustration, which shows an intermediate band where the white band occurs near the northern tip of Africa.  I had a closer look at the maps I found in the library, and none of them improves on what was in that website. The one major difference that a revised map probably ought to take account of is the division of Australia into two regions. I'll make overlays to check, but it looks like the only other changes involve reducing 8 zones to 5. If you check out the Cavelli-Sforza map (which I now think is a photo reproduction of the original map) you can easily understand why authors would decide to simplify the number of zones  Cavelli-Sforza's map is o.k. for the lighter half of the shades of skin color, but the darker shades are practically indistinguishable.  Sometimes, if you know where to look, you will see what looks like a little halftoning rather than straight black ink. But for practical purposes the map is pretty useless outside of the values that are shown in the Americas. § In a way it was a good thing that the original map was so washed out. If I hadn't really looked carefully at it I'm pretty sure I'd have missed the white band. The uncorrected map has propagated so many places on the WWW that it's hard to believe the original maker of the digitized image has any objection to others using it.  ==Cleanup==We need to clean up the article. The sections should only treat what it says they do in the section title. For example, there shouldn't be a paragraph ``:``In everyday speech, race is often used to describe populations that are better defined as ethnic groups...``at the end of ``History of the term``. Nor should the ``Anthropology and genetics`` section, being placed after the history section, i.e. we are through with the historical aspect now, begin with :``In the 19th century many natural scientists made three claims about race: ...``(i.e. this bit still belongs in the 'history' section). Also the case studies (USA, Brazil) should either be exported to special articles, or at least be placed after the more general phylogenetic subsection. Somebody should read the entire article and weed out repetitions, too.  == Von Luschan scale ==§ The von Luschan scale was a manufactured set of standard tiles that were colored so that a researcher could in relatively rapid order sort through his/her tiles and find the one that came closest to matching a given subject's skin color. Essentially the same method is still used today, at least in this increasingly anti-scientific nation, by dentists who want to match ceramic material used for making fillings with the color of their patient's tooth. They have a little cabinet full of ceramic ``teeth`` on little spindles. Each specimen has a different combination of hue and brightness from the others. Although one could easily create an electronic device to measure these factors to tighter tolerances, the low-tech device seems to meet professional standards. Similarly, given the fact that a subject's skin color could vary considerably due to contingent factors such as season and weather patterns, the von Luchan tiles probably provide all the accuracy that is useful. `
0	`::There is no difference in rhetoric. The quote that Jayjg took out of context was a citation from the Qur'an that Hamas uses (also out of context) to justify the killing of Jews. Zionists use similar tactics (that's where Hamas learned it) by quoting the Torah and Talmud to justify the killing of non-Jews. ``We must treat the Arabs like the Amalekites`` is a common sentiment among extremist Zionists. There are quotes from Zionist rabbis on this page that are indistinguishable from the logic of Hamas clerics. The denial of Zionism's genocidal intent and practice is similar to Nazis who denied the Holocaust and Final Solution even as they conducted it. Zionists claim to be ethical and humanitarian while routinely killing hundreds of children, imprisoning thousands of adults and oppressing millions of non-Jews in the name of their Jewish supremacist ideology and state.  `

What happened to every claim? Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals! You need to post the names of prominent Islamic scholars and universities such as Al Azhar (not isolated radicals) who issued the death sentence against these people. The fatwa  against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries except Iran. So all you need to do is post Islamic sites (not anti-Islamic sites and isolated radical sites) who issued the death sentence against Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc. Bring your proof. Just throwing the names of isolated cases where someone received death threats from isolated anonymous radical doesn't prove Islam sanctions death sentence to it's critics! After 9/11, many Muslims and mosques received threats and some Muslims/Sikhs were even killed. That doesn't mean the US sanctions death to all American Muslims.  You are such a pathetic joke, dude!  Posting isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals doesn't prove a thing. We don't even know for sure who killed Rashad. You added even his name. You need to post the names of Muslim scholars who issues death sentence against, say, Rashad, Vincent van Gogg, and Menji. Then you need to post evidence that this was consensus among Muslim scholars on each of these cases.  Without that, you don't have any case, and you are refuted once again  : ``Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals!  You need to post the names of prominent Islamic scholars and universities such as Al Azhar (not isolated radicals) who issued the death sentence against these people. The fatwa  against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries`` <- these anonymous radicals represent the sentiments felt by their factions in ISlam -they represent their interpretation of Islam. I also provided examples of critics who were murdered by MUHAMMAD himself. Al-Azhar is not a higher authority than Muhammad.::No, you have only provided two stories in Ibn Ishaq about Muhammad that are rejected by Muslims, such as rejected here.  Al Azhar and Muslim scholars will interpret what Muhammad did and what Islamic law says, not an anti-Islamic bigot like you. You made a bold claim that in Islam critics are to be to be killed. I refuted that by giving examples that contradict that. You then claimed that every critic received a death sentence. You were refuted again. You then posted a list of isolated critics such as Rushdie, Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc, who received death threats from anonymous radicals. That's like posting (a much longer list) of Muslims/Sikhs who received death threats or were killed after 9/11, and claiming that American law allows Muslims to be killed. You were refuted again.  You need to provide names of prominent well known Muslim scholars (not anti-Islam sites or isolated radicals) for each of these cases and prove that they issued the death sentence. After that, you need to provide proof that that judgement was a consensus among Muslims scholars. You didn't do that. You were refuted once again. Since you are an anti-Islamic bigot, you can't just claim that Muhammad did this or that or Islamic law says this or that and expect that claim to be inserted in Encyclopedia. You need to provide proof. You couldn't because you were wrong. Try again, dude. You have failed quite miserably here  :Furthermore, whe opinons of secular governments are irrelevant - of course Musilm countries rejected the death fatwa against Rushdie, but this was due to international politics, not due to religion. Also, as stated before, Ayatollah Khomenie was a Shiah CLERIC. The only way to be an Ayatollah is to be born as one. Aside from being the dictator or IRan, Khomenie was also the spiritial and religious leader of huge numbers of Sha'ias around the world. Khomenie wrote many fatwas and books about Islam. His most famous fatwa, of course, calls for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Now Al-Azhar - a SUNNI university  SUPPOSEDLY rejected KHomenei's teachings. This does not mean by any means prove that Al-Azhar was right, and Khomenie was wrong. The fact that KHomenie was a shiah cleric, while Al-Azhar is a sunni university is also a  gaping hole in this argument. You have no ev

Combined with his ceasless personal attacks, false accusations, and insistance on making wikipedia a propoganda machine for Islamist apologetics of the blackest kind, his behaviour has become completely intolerable, and I do not see any point in constantly refuting the same false accusations and false assertions over and over again. OneGuy must be ejected from this discussion before it can have any hope of being a civiled and productive debate. I am left with no choice but to completely resign from this discussion, since it seems that no one is going to be moderating OneGuy's behaviour anytime soon.

Looks like Muhammad's best friends are the infidels.  ::As of moderating OneGuy's behavior, the Arbitrators are looking into him and myself after he filed a hypocritical arbitration request against me and I thus filed a countercomplaint against OneGuy.  Whenever OneGuy spots someone who doesn't agree with his radical apologistic viewpoint he tries to silence them by any means at his disposal.  OneGuy, in his complaint in arbitration, accused me of rivert(sic) wars and having POV in my contributions yet he does the exact same thing, only more so.  In the arbitration complaint, the arbitrators don't seem as concerned about the POV contributions as they do about personal attacks, revert wars and my vandalism of his user page. See Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34.  When OneGuy was giving evidence against me he incorrectly called a few minor word changes as a revert war (even though the change were only made once or twice) and he clearly left out the revert wars in which he was involved (but the arbitrators were not fooled - they found him out).::Since the arbitrators will probably not do anything about his radical apologistic contributions, they will most likely respond to his vandalism of the talk pages.

He now claims that he did not copy the verse from anti-Islamic site. If true, where did he find the interpretation that 8:67 means kill prisoners of war? He implied that interpretation in the article. At worst, the verse condemns the behavior of taking prisoners in order to make money, but he has not given his source that says 8:67 means kill prisoners.

You see, that's how it got the name ``al-Aqsa``. The Israeli government propaganda repeated at the websites you list claims that the Palestinians started the al-Aqsa intifada before Sharon even visited the al-Aqsa site. Even the ``Palestine Facts`` source you cite and the objective Mitchell report point to Sharon's visit as the trigger for the al-Aqsa intifada. Of course there is constant violence in the area so anyone can name his own start date. We can go back to 1948 or 1917 if you want. It does no service to Wikipedia to throw Israeli government propaganda into the article. ( I am sure that won't stop you though).    ::*``Also on September 28, 2000, Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. This visit became the pretext for instigating large scale demonstrations, the start of the al-Aqsa infifada.``  ::*``On September 28, 2000, Ariel Sharon marched defiantly and provocatively through the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, touching off the current round of violence. ``   ::The Mitchell Report:::*``Mr. Sharon made the visit on September 28 accompanied by over 1,000 Israeli police officers. Although Israelis viewed the visit in an internal political context, Palestinians saw it as highly provocative to them. On the following day, in the same place, a large number of unarmed Palestinian demonstrators and a large Israeli police contingent confronted each other. According to the U.S. Department of State, ``Palestinians held large demonstrations and threw stones at police in the vicinity of the Western Wall. Police used rubber-coated metal bullets and live ammunition to disperse the demonstrators, killing 4 persons and injuring about 200.``[4] According to the GOI, 14 Israeli policemen were injured.[5] Similar demonstrations took place over the following several days.[6] Thus began what has become known as the ``Al-Aqsa Intifada`` (Al-Aqsa being a mosque at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount). ``  ::Furthermore, in the article Terrorism_against_Israel_in_2000#August, it says Biri died in August after being attacked by ``terrorists``. (If Biri was an Israeli soldier in occupied Gaza, why are his attackers called ``terrorists`` in Wikipedia?). You need to sort out your Israeli propaganda to at least get the dates and descriptors right. ::``* August 27: Terrorists attack a group of vehicles traveling to Netzarim with two roadside bombs and automatic gunfire.  David Biri, age 19, is wounded.::* August 28: David Biri dies of wounds suffered in a Palestinian terrorist attack the previous day.::* September 29: Border policeman Chief Inspector Yossi Tabaji, 27, of Ramle, killed and a second Israeli border policeman wounded by a Palestinian Authority policeman on a joint patrol near Kalkiliya District Coordinating Office. ``::Yossi Tabaji and several unnamed Palestinian youth were also killed in the days before the ``official start`` of the al-Aqsa intifada because there are constant killings almost every day in the conflict. The al-Aqsa intifada is an upsurge in the violence that started after Sharon's visit to the al-Aqsa site. That is the commonly understood definition of al-Aqsa intifada. Adding stories about Israeli deaths that happened the day before is just Israeli government propaganda to deflect blame away from Ariel Sharon.  `

When the Muslims attempt to enter al-Aqsa for prayers they were barred and later Israeli forces opened fire at the civilian demonstrators, including children, killing 6 and wounding 220. In the first few days of the Intifada, the IDF fired about 700,000 bullets in the West Bank, and 300,000 in Gaza. In the first six days of the Intifada, 61 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces and 2,657 were injured, many of them children. At the same time four Israelis were killed, with 35 wounded.`` . Why are the names of Israeli soldiers like David Biri and Yossi Tabaji more important than the names of the numerous Arab civilian victims?

She had been a senior at the Evergreen State College in Olympia, where she studied the arts and international relations. She took a leave of absence to participate in resistance against the IDF as a member of the Palestinian-led International Solidarity Movement (ISM).

Which there isn't.  It's all a matter of scenarios and guesses.The ``Limits to Growth`` type of numerical modelling, largely discredited now, was the actual origin of the ``sustainable`` paradigm.Today ecologists are far more concerned with homeostasis, keystone species, and homeorhetic process, none of which benefit much from external measures of ``sustainability``.Complex problem.

0	`What I find, reading these paragraphs, is a decidedly pro-Zayed bias. To assume that anyone who criticizes him in that article must have never went near the Middle East, or the UAE, is preposterous. My own contributions, as well as others, are based on travel and life in the UAE, as well as trustworthy sources like the BBC and Reuters, among others. Also, that he funded all those wonderful projects around the world is not in dispute. To say that it was from his own pocket, however, is ludicrous. As with all the rich Gulf leaders, their personal wealth CAME from the nation's oil wealth. Their checkbooks and the State Treasury were often indistinguishable. Nevertheless, Zayed could have easily chosen to horde the UAE's wealth only for Emiratis, but he didn't, and that is evident. As far as the propaganda pictures and TV footage Falcon44 refers to, I have seen it with my own eyes. It does not negate what he did, but it's important to edify readers that Media in the UAE is strictly controlled, and cult-worship of the ruling families was institutionalized. Again, this does not mean that Zayed was not genuinely liked and admired, but it is important to state all the facts. The simple fact is that there was not one jot of criticism allowed on the airwaves or in print. This is no great slur on Zayed or the UAE. The only 3 relatively lively and free presses in the Arab world are Lebanon, Egypt, and pre-war Kuwait. Qatar is just now experimenting with free media. Regardless, what is more evidence of a pro-Zayed bias then the systematic removal of every scrap of criticism from the article? Why do certain individuals not want the world to know that one of his weddings is recorded in the Guinness Book of Records as the most expensive ever? Why are they afraid to let people know that Zayed's ``election`` to the Presidency was by a mere group of 6 sheiks and not by a free and popular vote? All these facts were shamelessly deleted several times from the article. THAT is what I call bias. Also, you quoted one of his advisors. It is not very shocking that such a person would be overflowing with praise about his employer and benefactor. I do not consider that an objective source. That doesn't mean it cannot be mentioned. As long as it is made clear who said it, the readers can draw their own conclusions about the possible bias of the quotation.  Perhaps you should include that quotation in the article, Falcon. Also, regarding the Zayed Center, that was not my contribution, but I find it very interesting. What you mentioned about it in this talk section is very important. I look forward to you expanding on how he founded the center, and why he became disenchanted with it and withdrew his support.Oh, incidentally, it would be a great help if you, and all contributors, made use of the ``edit summary`` section so that the rest of us can more efficiently keep track of who added/deleted what and for what reason.

0	====Chinese yo-yo → Diabolo====Entry for Diabolo was removed and the topic nowadays just redirects to Chinese yo-yo. Chinese yo-yo is not the correct name for the item depicted in the entry. The juggling prop is called Diabolo universally in juggling circles. The original move was probably initiated by an ill-informed newbie to the art. The content of the page has deteroriated as people have been removing stuff which does not relate to Chinese yo-yo (which also looks different). Also the external links and the picture are irrelevant to 'Chinese yo-yo' as they clearly refer to Diabolo. Diabolo and Chinese yo-yo are quite two different things. I propose leaving a new empty entry for Chinese yo-yo which could be used to tell about the particular item. Addition: To see what I mean. Here's a Chinese Yo-Yo and here's a Diabolo. I ask for this change now because I thought someone more proficient with Wikipedia would come to resque and correct the error.    * Support - Initiated by me. I wrote much of the original Diabolo entry.   * Support - I've never heard the item depicted and described in that article refered to as anything but diabolo. —  * Support - I used to juggle diabolos, and I never called it a Chinese yo-yo.  * Support - I don't think it is fair to characterise the original move as ill-informed. But if different editors are pulling in different directions, it sounds like you may have a case for demerging the article. Diabolo can then concentrate on the juggling and Chinese yo-yo can concentrate on its origins, history, and use in Chinese dance etc. In which case a straight move wouldn't be required.

The USSR qualifies under those definitions, under the vast majority of non-Marxist scholarship (we have already dealt with the sources issue at length), as reflected in Britannica and Encarta which both deal with the former USSR at length and very adequately synthesize that scholarship into long articles. Also, earlier versions of this article included the terms and were edited out. I encourage those interested to go back and see what went on previously. The issue is whether ``totalitarian dictatorships`` are non-neutral language. I don't think they are non-neutral at all.  The words have meaning, I think Fred has written at length on how the USSR qualified and I defer to his effort. Perhaps someone should post it up here. Now is the time to resolve it. `

0	I don't like the last paragraph. Holding that you have some particular negative right doesn't mean that you believe that you have a right to make others protect you from having that right violated. That would mean you had double standard, in that you say you have negative rights, but someone else doesn't and therefore it's ok for you to coerce him to protect your negative rights. This would be an akward position to hold, and i doubt many people do hold it. So, I'm thinking about deleting the paragraph. (RJII) Dec 23 2004

They include Erzya, Meadow Mari, Hill Mari, Komi, Udmurt, Khanty, Mansi, Hungarian, Nenets, Selkup, Nganasan, Kamassian, Livonian, Estonian, Finnish (eastern dialects), Votic, Veps, and Northern Sami. There was no information on some minor languages in the book, but it can be easily seen that palatalization is common in every branch of the Uralic language family.  `
0	`== Synagogue ==Hi there! One or two comments and, please, do not be offended: Synagogue comes from the greek words συν 'syn' = con (as in 'con-servative' for example) and αγωγή 'agogi' = discipline/manner/education, which itself comes from the verb άγειν 'agein' = lead (also look here: http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=synagogue)The word 'agogi' from the ancient times (and even today!) has an absolutely positive meaning: for example, in modern Greece, people say ``He has agogi`` meaning ``He has manners``, ``He knows how to behave`` etc.Therefore, I would ask you to accept my previous correction, which for some reason you thought it was offending or negative. It is NOT. That's how it is in Greek, and that's the truth... Kokoriko: 13:09 pm GMT, 9/1/05`

0	-The first paragraph of the 'notable characteristics' section states that aluminium is both soft and strong. This seems unlikely to be the case. In the case of pure aluminium the yield strength is in the region of 10 MPa which certainly isn't strong as far as construction materials are concerned (Al alloys may have yield strengths in the region of 200-500 MPa). As a result I have removed the word strong (alloying is mentioned later anyway).Surely aluminium is not resistent to magnetism but is simply non-magnetic? I have altered the 'applications' section to reflect this (and hopefully I'm right).The term 'weak' is ambiguous (strength, stiffness, hardness, toughness, fatigue resistance?). I replaced it with a link to tensile strength as this is probably the most familar mechanical property.

0	== Vic arious Liability ==An employer is vicariously liable for negligent acts or omissions by his employee in the course of employment whether or not such act or omission was specifically authorised by the employer. To avoid vicarious liability, an employer must demonstrate either that the employee was not negligent in that the employee was reasonably careful or that the employee was acting in his own right rather than on the employer's business.It can also be understood this way: When one person is liable for the negligent actions of another person, even though the first person was not directly responsible for the injury. For instance, a parent can be vicariously liable for the harmful acts of a child and an employer can be vicariously liable for the acts of a worker.This I find very interesting, thinking of whether a demarcation exist. When can one say that the Employer is exonerated from the employee's acts, especially if the employee used the resources provided by the Employer (Tools, Vehicles, Landed Property etc)?I require additional research to give more details.If however anybody has anything to add, please assist.

0	OK. I notice last night about 5 am or so Wyss said to me 'goodnight Ennis' which is just yet another personal attack - unpunished (of course). Anyway I followed your advice and have taken the 'challenge' to I am not asking you to comment - I know you have to/want to/feel the need to 'keep in' with other Wikis and I am just an anonymous Brit (or worse - Sollog Arrrgh!) I am just bringing the challenge to your attention as I suspect Wyss will avoid it and the post will be reverted - and his £2000 (or equivalent) will not go to help the bereaved. Remember - no comment required.   
0	I wonder why you think it's absurd to a) try and raise funds for those harmed by a natural disaster and b) to prove once and for all that these repetitive - almost chanting - claims I am Ennis are false. If the 'Number is Ennis' dichotomy was removed the Talk Pages would be near empty! I wonder why you condemn my attempts to bring honesty to these pages.But, that's rhetorical - as I said, there must be certain camaraderie among Wiki people and I doubt if you’d want to jeopardise that even if your quest was integrity.Now you have asked me a sensible question, so I'll answer.For some time I watched these pages and saw that posts from people in the UK/claiming they were in the UK were summarily dismissed. Worse, posters were automatically accused of being Ennis.One reason given was that the posts were anonymous.So I thought, as I know more about Ennis than others from the UK posting here (IMO) I'd try to add to these pages. However, even with an identity, I got exactly the same treatment. In fact Cardinal Chunder also got the same treatment even though he has an anti-Sollog website and is well known in Google groups for arguing with sollog(ites).So it became clear that it would be impossible to add anything constructive unless either the accusations 'You're a sock puppet! You’re Ennis!' were either suppressed or disproved.I therefore asked what the criteria would be to 'prove' I was not Ennis - and presumably this criteria would apply to others. I tried to prove I was not in America (I thought these days all IPs were traceable but perhaps the 'proxy argument' holds sway - though quite how 'proxies work' is beyond me) I quoted extracts from a newspaper that was not on the net.This was dismissed.Someone else even went to a pub in Lyndhurst and posted what was next to where he was sitting.That too was dismissed.So it became obvious that no proof I (or anyone else) was not Ennis would ever be accepted.Therefore the only other option if I felt I had something to contribute would be to suppress the hyena-like accusations (never backed up BTW)In vain did I quote Wiki Official Policy. Plainly it is not obeyed by Editors/Administrators vis a vis the treatment of contributors.So what is left? I cannot invoke Wiki policy. I cannot 'prove' I am here, in England sitting quietly in front of a PC.Two choices.Stop posting completelyTry and 'challenge' the main accuser so once and for all this behaviour would stop. The only challenge worth it would be one where I did not personally gain (Of course I would win because I am not Ennis) and where proof involving a third party held in esteem (e.g. Ashley) acted as 'witness'.Hence the challenge.I fear that will be deleted; I'll be castigated a usual and that's that. It really is just hopeless.I have started deleting all my posts and if the challenge is reverted I’ll know there simply is no hope and I'll delete all my posts if I can find them.You see, unless people accept I am not Ennis everything I or anyone else writes who is similarly accused will simply be dismissed. I'd prefer it if people read the post without looking at the poster - but they don't.I have other interests - I posted on the Yoga page but it's quiet and I am interested in politics etc etc.So we'll see what happens. Like I said, my view is that it's just hopeless trying to treat others as adults as all some want to do is - and they admit this - bait, bait and bait and if you do rise to it you're banned and if you don't it shows your inability. Truly a page that brings out the juvenile in what I assume are adults.So there you are. I have answered your question fully and honestly and we'll just see what happens. It will answer the question - at least for these Sollog pages - as to whether Wiki should be taken seriously or not.Finally if, as expected, the post is reverted it will provide a fitting end to the article I am writing (I am a freelance writer and no, I’m not going to prove it) before I send it off to newspapers. If it is accepted though I shall return just the once, to link to the article!   
0	==To Gamaliel==I see Wyss has now deleted all my recent posts on his page - without (he claims) even reading them. One of the posts was asking him to explain where the Sollog prophecies were wrong (I linked to them).

I'd be better off elsewhere.Wiki is not 'out of control' - it's 'too much in control' and the accusations of Wiki Cult certainly have some bearing.

0	`-Continued:I checked the history of recent edits.I find it hypocritical that the words ``sell`` and ``price`` have been changed to ``offer`` and ``donation``. What the * is that all about?Is it because THC Ministry has been registered as a religion that the action of trading funds for a product has ``miraculously`` transformed from simple business to ``donations`` and ``offerings``? That is marketing speech. That is in no way different from any businessman's simple strategy.Since THC Ministry supposedly ``offers`` a product in exchange of a ``donation``, shouldn't that imply that they would also give away freely the product in some cases? Shouldn't that imply that there would be no set price, as a donation is usually considered an act of variable value? Because otherwise that is just PLAIN BUSINESS. Nothing saintly about it.I would like to know - just to clear things out - where these ``donations`` go to and who they benefit. Are the funds used to address the issues of unethical drug wars? Are the funds used to fight what is wrong in society? Or are they merely collected to the personal accounts of the ``priesthood`` of THC Ministry? Who could answer me?If one would allow oneself a cynical outlook, he'd certainly see this as a pretty package covering a simple money-making scheme.Juuso`
0	`==Changes, subtle errors ==Oleg, I am concerned about the edits that you are making.  My first impression is that it is much harder to understand than it used to be.  It used to be precise as to what it meant; much of that precision has been removed. The result is the sublte introduction of errors...   in part by removing that precision.  For example, the ring over tau_p is not isomorphic to the ring x^n^p which is what you seem to be implying; the degrees of polynomials are totatlly different: if P(tau) is a polynomial, then  n^(deg P(tau)) = deg P(x) one is kind-of-like the exp/ad of the other, sort-of.  And you cut out the paragraphs that made this distinction: tau a is not equal to a tau, but tau a is equal to a^p tau ...The ring is never commutative when the field is not F_p ... The field is called F_p not Z/pZ dammit. We already talked about this before. Nobody but you calls it that.Stating that aP(x) is also additive is important, I don't see why you cut that out. k{tau} is not k[x] e.g the next theorem to mention is that for any p(x) in k[x] there exists a g(tau) in k{tau} such that f(x) divides g(x).  These g(tau)'s are a left ideal in k{tau}Using language like ``its quite easy to prove`` and ``it follows quickly`` and ``it can be shown that`` is, at best, filler, and, at worst, misleading as to the actual difficulty of the theorems you are alluding to.Look, I don't see why you need to be monkeying with this article, why don't you write an article on Ore's invariants of the additive polynomials, or the moore determinant instead, hell, there is no entry for the vandermonde determinant even ...  or start the article on a carlitz module or drinfeld module instead, or fix the article on non-archimedean analysis which really needs a lot of work, cause its missing all that jazz ...  `

Efficient progress is not illegal as long as it is not against the Humanitist directives and there is always a way for the clergy to observe Torah protocols.

0	`*********************************Josif Stalin IS one of the three worst criminals in the history of mankind, the other two being Hitler and Mao. Mao killed 38 million human beings, Stalin at least 25 million and Hitler at least 20 million. The figures are there on the CIA website. It is unacceptable to show Stalin and Mao as politicians on Wikipedia website when Hitler is depicted as a monster. All of them were equally monsters and the personal cult communism was no differenct from nazism in essence.You need to be aware that most former eastern bloc countries banned the use and display of the five-pointed red star and the hammer and sickle symbols of communism alongside the swastika and some local fascist sysmbols, because they know from personal experience that the horrors of stalinism were no less than that of nazism. The hungarian law banning all these is the XLV. (45th) law of 1993, titled ``Az önkényuralmi jelképek használatát tiltó törvény`` and it has been upheld in constitutional court.If you fail to mention the very criminality of Stalin and Mao in the very header of their wiki articles, then you are looking for an edit war, period. We, the people of ex-soviet bloc countries are personally insulted when anglo-saxons pet ``Uncle Joe`` as the kind old leader. Be glad he did not rule you (you may not have been born then with 10% probability because your father would get executed or die in the Gulags beforehand, no kidding). Acknowledge our sufferings by stating the truth: Stalin was one of the three worst criminals in the history of mankind, period.Regards: Tamas Feher from Hungary (etomcat@freemail.hu)`
0	`You are Stalin apologets. Where is placed the mention of Katyin massacre, where several thousands of polish POVs were shot by NKVD upon Stalin's personal order? We hugarians are very close brothers of the polish people historically, so I find the lack of proper and emphasized mention of Katyin very painful. Stalin's crimes against Poland are amongst the most outrageous in written history. There is no excuse to the Molotov-Rippentropp pact. Make no mistake that was the Hitler-Stalin pact.I really wish Stalin ruled you, not us. You are like Rumsfeld, who met Saddam during mid-1980s and praised him as a good ally in the anti-Khomeini Iran war. When will you realize that Putyin's current rule is an analog of Stalin's, characterized by extreme disregard for law, anti-semitism (most notably the early 50's doctor trials vs. 2004's Khodorkovski-Yukos) and imperialism (brutal military actions in the Caucasian Mountains both times and desire to the rule neighbours). Thus, by not mentioning Stalins criminality in unambigious terms, you hold the english-speaking world blind to Putyin's methods and you contribute to a ``new Uncle Joe`` sentiment, which will inevitable put the world and the poor Russian race in great danger. A repetition of history for those who refuse to learn about the past.Stalin started his reign with a few million dead, by reversing Lenin's post-civil-war ``new economic policy`` of limited private agriculture thus leading to big famine.The entire WWII in Europe would be over in 6-9 months had Stalin failed to entirely decapitate the soviet army's elite in 1937-39, this is clearly written in vol. 2. of soviet published seven-volume ``The history of the Great Patriotic War 1941-1945``. You are plain stupid to praise Stalin for a ``hard earned victory in WWII``.So powerful was the fear of Stalin's evil power, that even us hungarians, who previously fought three revolutions and independence wars in the last 300 years, did not dare to raise again until autumn 1956 to free ourselves from stalinism. Anglo-saxons betrayed us big time then, shame on the Free World.In churches renovated after WWII (big destruction in Hungary) the face of the Satan (as defeated by arch-angel Michael) is always of Josif Stalin's on wall paintings. People were shot for painting that.Regards: Tamas Feher.`

0	== Ross Perot and the Reform Party ==I edited to include Ross Perot because his candidacy everywhere was talked about as appealing to the 'radical middle' (in the press even). He said he was a social moderate and fiscal conservative, but his general tone was of centrismwhich is why for years after 'swing voters'/centrist voters/independents were called 'Perot voters'. On most issues he came to compromises between Democrats and Republicans with hard solutions. For instance he said both tax cuts and tax increases were needed. He also felt that partisanship and gridlock between the parties caused most problems, including incessant debates on social issues like abortion. But he promoted issues that appealed to the center (that weren't just plain 'centrist' but pro-active positions that at that time hadn't been talked about much before) like balanced budgets, campaign finance reform, referendums, term limits, etc.The Reform Party was based on this platform and was radically centristmembers even called themselves 'centrist'. People in the party felt there were definite issues that needed to be solved, and the two major parties had to be challenged to solve them, with the creation of a new party. Today, many might say the party has a chink in this line of thought, because after Pat Buchanan and his supporters entered the party in the 2000 election, hard stances on immigration started to enter party platforms.Which is somewhat right-but even still it doesn't compromise on the idea. I read Noam Chomsky once wrote that in America the groups on the fringes of politicslike Nader on the left, Buchanan on the right, and Perot in the center, agreed substantially on their significant issuesand he proposed that they joined together in a pretzel to form the 'radical middle'. A radical 'centrist' is an uneasy concept, since politics always changes and what will be moderate will change. The idea here though is that there is a growing set of issues that is not shared by left or right parties (fair trade, campaign finance reform, balanced budgets). That those who support these issues also carry different baggage of their own, tied to left-right positions, like Buchanan with abortion or immigration, should be expected.If you're talking about John McCain, he plays to many of these positions (but is still free trade). But he's usually still what you might call a 'sensible' centrist and usually falls on the right, where he is. I was in the Reform Party (i think my analysis is accurate so don't bring up the bias), and many members hated McCain because he was a 'false reformer'-for instance his McCain-Feingold act made it even harder for third parties, while not doing anything substantial for reform. The sentiment was that he was just taking advantage of the issues for his public image. If you even listen to his speeches on reform he gives no substance just uses the phrase 'special interests' liberally.From what I know about UK politics, Tony Blair looks more like Clintonesque centrism (which is purely political) than anything else.

0	 that will substantiate your claim that the Iraq Liberation Act was a violation of international law
0	I realize that several people (apparently including Rama) have attempted to point to Israel's bombing of Osiraq as the catalyst for Iraq's nuclear program, but it just does not hold up to scrutiny. Iraqi defectors as well as the IAEA's post Gulf War investigations found that Iraq had a clandestine program dating back to the late 1970's. Most of Iraq's nuclear work was done at Al Tuwaitha. Although the IAEA had access to Al Tuwaitha, it was extremely limited with the majority of the complex off limits to IAEA inspectors because no “declared nuclear activity” was taking place there. Evidently Blix saw nothing wrong with this.For the section quoting (although I did not include the quote to avoid POV) Blix praising Iraq compliance on the eve of the Invasion of Kuwait and during the beginning of Iraq's crash bomb program: NuclearFuel, August 20, 1990

0	 Jan 2005 (UTC)::Generally, I don't acknowledge the comments of someone who goes out of his/her way to talk down to me.  Suffice it to say that the burden of proof is on you and the Democrats to prove that the Grand Kleagle is NOT a racist pig of a Senator.  He was the one who choose to join the Klan, it was he that choose to recruit new members to the cross-burning organization.  It was NOT me that made him do those things.  It was him that wrote several articles defending the Klan after he supposedly left it.  It was him that as recently as 2001 was throwing around the n-word.  He is the racist, not me.  You have chosen to use your time and effort to defend the racist.  You need to look inside you for your personal motivation on why you feel that you must defend the racist.  The section of the article defending the Kleagle is indefensible.  Look at Trent Lott's bio.  There is no Republican writing an apology for Lott's comments.  Why do you feel the need to defend the Kleagle?  Oh, by the way, I can't believe that I even responded to you.  I only responded because you are fellow Jayhawk, but I normally would not respond to comments of your tone.  I will continue to remove and edit any untrue information that you place in an article also.  Only 13 Senators voted against Rice.  That is 13% of the Senators.  That is not a large segment of the societyno matter how hard you try to make people believe that it is.  The one African-American Senator did not vote against her.  Only the most partisan Democrats voted against her.- 01:19, 31
0	`== US emissions description is totally contentless now. ==The US section is total nihil. It is nothing more than a circular self-referencing system of cryptic abbreviations, without absolutely any kind of numerical data to back it up! I guess you do not understand? Well, based on the wikipedia info a US ``partial zero emissions vehicle`` could either be a bicycle (where the only emission is the cyclist's fart, to be rude) or a modified Hummer H1 SUV having an 1000 bhp Kenworth truck engine. There is no numerical info on the page to let us decide which is the case.Any person could create a system of circularly self-referencing acronyms and abbreviations for emissions categories out of thin air. Yet, it would still be zero information content. So either delete the US emissions section or add the numerical data (how many grams of CO2, NOx, SOx, unburnt fuel, particle charcoal matter are emitted per distance travelled) to back up those cryptic PZEV and alike codes with verifieable information.Look at the Euro-X standard descriptions. Each one is just a single sentence and it tells us the truth frankly. Weight and numbers, nothing else matters. Acronyms are PR bullshit and do not belong to an ecyclopaedia.It is a shame US people do not dare to face the polluting nature of their monster cars and try to hide the sad ``20mpg`` reality behind cryptic PZEV and similar abbreviations. In Europe 65mpg is reality now.Regards:Tamas Feher from Hungary``etomcat@freemail.hu```

0	`: For the benefit of the many, let's elaborate on ``A clear misuse of Juran's assumption (...)``:: In manufacturing, systems are designed so that everybody contributes a pre-defined amount of work, especially in synchronous settings such as assembly lines. Nobody could argue for a Pareto distribution there.: In agriculture and mining, individual contributions are sometimes measurable (e.g. basketful of apples picked per person per shift). A for-profit organization seeks out ``good`` workers, so the bottom part of the distribution will not be represented at all. Family and community operations often find a way to gainfully employ persons with less strength (e.g. 11-year-old girls) or with disabilities (e.g. blind people), but their number is not large enough to warrant a Pareto distribution.: Which brings us to the only economic system many readers have experience of: The services sector. In it, there is a place for ``stars`` in fields like moviemaking and advertising, where moneymaking ability is so narrowly distributed that it can sustain not just an 80:20 modeling, but 90:10 and even 99:1 (think of the distribution of pay in the fashion modeling world).: In other service areas, such as software development, it has been argued (and many influential minds such as Frederick Brooks and Joel Spolsky have devised methods for measuring and quantifying this) that a top designer, programmer, or QA person is roughly ten times as effective  as an average one.:It can be agued that this observation distribution does not carry to other areas of computing such as system administration.: Finally, the difference between top waiters (or shoe salespeople) and average ones may not warrant any Pareto analysis.:  `

0	`:My edits do conform to a neutral point of view, I am correcting entries that are not NPOV. For example saying ``there was opposition from many`` is a weasel remark as there was also 'support from many'. The article on Government positions on Iraq is NPOV but the reference to it is not, the reference to it should be either deleted, moved down to the section that specifically deals with support and opposition, or be changed as I have done on a number of occasions to indicate that there was support AS WELL AS opposition to the invasion.`

0	`== Some things to note about Stalin ==1., Many and most photos of Stalin are either heavily doctored or even fake. He was known to aviod photographers because his face was ugly from heavy pitting and canker. He had a number of better-looking doubles (stand-ins) to serve in PR opportunities. He used to stand on high/remote pedestrals when must appear in public to avoid close scrunity.2., It is a commonly held opinion in Eastern Europe (I think it is a fact) that Josif Dsugasvili was an ordinary highwayman by profession before he joined the revolutionaries. He used to rob trains with a grops of outlaws, forcing people to stand and deliver.3., Isn't it strange the Stalin Wikipedia article does not include the word dictator / dictatorship (or anything that starts with dict*) at all according to IE's search? Political correctness should not run amok, especially considering this is english language Wikipedia and US people know very little about foreign relations and history by school education, so it is easy to indoctrinate them by ``kind ol' Uncle Joe`` babble. Or do you think only ancient roman leaders can be called a ``dictator`` per definitionem? Most of Stalin's actions were clearly outside the realm of politics (which means debate and negotiations vs. headshot) so calling him a politician is an offense to leaders who spent their entire life serving their nation and all of its citizens in accordance with the people's will.4., Did Stalin murder his wife? Has this issue been settled conclusively?5., Hungarian people depicted while expressing their most sincere sentiments towards dead Stalin by toppling and decorating his giant statue in Budapest during the 1956 revolution:``http://www.sulinet.hu/eletestudomany/archiv/2000/0042/forr/1319-2..jpg``Regards: Tamas Feher from Hungary``etomcat@freemail.hu```

I would also point out, again, for like the umpteenth fucking time, that this user has been using plagiarized material repeatedly and only takes it out after being beaten over the head with it. Secondly, don’t you fucking dare try and threaten me with what might and might not be said in arbitration.

The sectin in question was changed to:``It is known that the theoretical maximum electrical resistivity for water is approximately 182 kilohm-meters at 25 degrees Celsius. This figure agrees well with what is typically seen on reverse osmosis, ultrafiltered and deionized ultrapure water systems used for instance, in semiconductor manufacturing plants. A salt or acid contaminant level exceeding that of even 100 parts per trillion (ppt) in ultrapure water will begin to noticably raise its conductivity level by up to several hundred kilosiemens per meter.``Now, I know wikipedia must conform to standards, a policy which I am an ardent advocate of, and the meter is the SI unit of length as is the kilohm. However, ultrapure water is never, ever referred to using these units. It is always referred to as being 18.2 megohm-cm and has in fact been so often used with these terms that it has bcome synonymous with them and is often simply called ``megohm water`` in the literature.

0	`Dear Wikipedia ````Neutrality```` guardian, Re Saddam Hussein entry,no one has yet to answer my question, why do the live palestinians deserve mention in the primary intro for a non palestinian leader, but the Slaughtered Kurds of Saddam's own countrymen do not? You could have Written ``Some parts of the Arab world admired Saddam for standing up to the west``. Without mentioning the Palestinians, just like you refuse to mention the slaughtered Kurds. But you insist on mentioning the Palestinians, and further conceal any remnant of opposing POV with the fascist's friend, the term  ``human-rights situation`` which you hope anyone can interpret as anything. Are you claiming that the horrors both existed and didn't exist, depending on who you ask? where are all those dead kurds, then?revive them! I'm sure they will be glad to read in wikipedia that what was done to them was only ``a situation``. A situation is good. Elain in Seinfeld has situations. comes and goes. They can dig up their graves and go home to watch the reruns.Never mind the bodies, they will soon rot and everyone would have forgotten all about it. Shhhhhhh. But Only one thing as sure as the Sun existed, didn't it? The palestinians and their glee! thats as solid as Iron! who needs proof? its the Palestinians! Amen!Do you have a paraplegic handy by any chance? I want to know a rational arumgent of why it is so important and humanitarian to disguise Saddams undisputed, DNA proven horrors. It must be VERY important. there mustbe some divine logic here beyond my rationality.Oh, It will upset the palestinians? sure! don't you think Saddam's other little hobbies (other than encouraging palestinians) have upset at least the same number of people or largeer? why do you stifle their emphasis then?Either you stifle ALL non Iraqi effects of Saddam, or you mention them NEUTRALLYthat means not ONLY the palestinians! Are you perhaps saying that 10,000 gassed kurds and their millions of grieving relatives/supporters are less important than 2 million live palestinians with no direct contact to Iraqi affairs other than a blushing glee at Saddam's deeds?if so, how many? how many non-palestinians does it take to die till that issue becomes important enough to mention if it contrasts the palestinian POV?  a million? 6 million by any chance? does this number mean anything to you or do you just file it in you head as``Human rights situation``? and how many palestinians angry that 1+1=2 would it take for you to remove all thehenceforth controversial entries on mathematics? 3 palestinians? 4 perhaps?remember how to count women They won't like it unless you count women as 1:2 for men.they might cause something to your ``Human rights situation`` otherwise. And this pargraph:an increase in human-rights abuses, notably acts of genocide against Iraqi Kurds. The United States continued to view Saddam with deep suspicion, however, primarly due to his pursuit of weapons of mass destructiondo you have any factual references that dispute any of this? supported FACTS not 'liberal' wishful illusions!   all of it is corroborated in the links!And this,``Thanks for pointing this out. I suspect that it was removed because an anon is getting a kick out replacing non-controversial matter-of-fact statements like the above with overtly emotive, deliberately provocative ones.``Are you hinting that this sentence:``While he remained a popular hero among many disaffected Arabs for standing up to the West and for his unflinching support for the Palestinians``is a NPOV? what proof do you have of his support of the palestinians? are therany references of this, or just hearsay?Just call wikipedia the Western Edition of Pravda, and be done with it!(never mind that the Palestinian POV is merely matter of morale, and the opposing POV rests on actual crimes of war! how in your humane conscience can you condone this state of affairs?)And I dont wan't to skewer anyone either. If I wante to Skewer Saddam, I would have called him a Hitler wannabe; Little Stalin,  the prince of evil and so forth. This is skewering.Mentioning FACTS is never skewering, even if the palestinians don't like them!`

0	-As far as I know ancient Summerian and Babylonian writings conjecture that life might exist off Earth and indeed that aliens may have visted our planet. Seperating practical theorizing from mythologizing is of course difficult with ancient works. Anyhow, this places the idea of extraterrestrial life 3000 to 4000 yrs before the present day. Whether there were earlier theories I don't know. In other places where atronomy was independently invented (India, China etc.) its probably fair to assume that the idea of aliens must have arisen. Note that the five inner planets (excluding Earth) would all have appeared very unique to any society capable of looking at the stars systematically and would long have appeared good candidates for life.

The Roman numeric standard was an older form of numbering adopted for used by the the British from the Latin. For instance I (one) to X (ten), V (five) and III(three). So when the figure of XVIII is exactly 18 by our new standard. Therefore the name Mukim XVIII of Ang Mo Kio signify the area located on the Map. Presently it not the site of the New Town of Ang Mo Kio but just next along side. It was the housing estate built by the United Overseas Land Limited known as ``Faber Gardens``. This was the kampong area where our old attap dwelling used to stand at No. 126 A Lorong Kukus. In conclusion I suggest that the name of Mukim of Ang Mo kio is far older than the new Town of Ang Mo Kio. It is highly likely than the name was chosen by Town builders following that original name on the Map.`

0	Andy, thank you very much! )  What are the locations of those lost buildings?  All in Aachen?  I was wondering if the Holy Roman Empire was supposed to be inclusive for the whole of Western Europe, such as unofficially having traditionally independent places as England and other Catholic lands as subdivisions during that time.  The reason being, that there was only one emperor during those times(in the West) and only after Protestantism did multiple emperors become a feature of Western Europe.  Was the King of England a Sovereign during the time predating the Anglican schism, or was he subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor?  I postulate this, due to the fact that the Cardinals and Archbishops were subordinate to the Pope and figured that there's some part of history not being told to enough children.  Wouldn't that be a reason to break with the Vatican back then?  Once Henry broke with the Church, he was able to incorporate Wales and the Royal House changed from province to surname.  I was thinking that the provincial royal house like Anjou, Blois or Normandy is a Continental style.  Once England broke away, they went to personal names like Tudor and Stuart...even though Henry was technically of the House of Richmond.  Once England had become the center of another empire, just of its own, they reverted to usage of provincial houses.  So, what do you think...Am I right?

0	`== Ward Churchill is Not An Indian ==I am an enrolled member of Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and I used to work for the BIA. I added into the article the written opinions of people that have researched Churchill's Indian ancestry and 99% of these Indian folks point out that Churchill has not provided the basic information required to prove that he is an Indian. I put it up last night and it much of it was taken down early this morning. It was information where I provided sources for the comments. I understand that what I wrote can and should be edited. But taking out information that provides sources and citations seems to be an attempt to stifle the information. Dear Fred Bauder, it IS fair to ask if Churchill really is an Indian. He is taking away from actual Indian people the ability to speak for themselves. He has build his whole career on being someone who has experienced the oppression of a minority culture. It is similar to a white middle class Protestant person from Idaho was writing books about himself being a Jew in Hitler's Germany. And don't even say that I just made a inaccurate analogy because Churchill himself compares and uses Hitler and Nazi analogies. I'm sure that is how you learned about him in the first place because he made this most recent comment about 9/11 victims are all ``Eichmann's.`` Look, providing information about whether you are an Indian or not should not be that difficult. Why? You have Indian parents. It is simple as that. Even if you don't have brothers and sisters then you have Indian parents and your parents have brothers and sisters. Correct? Why doesn't anyone in Indian Country know any of these people? This is NOT a cheap shot as you indicated above. It goes to the heart of who he claims that he is. As Suzan Harjo pointed out: Churchill is taking jobs and speaking engagements from real actual Indians and building a whole career on it. Those jobs and speaking engagements should go to actual Indian. Also, Harjo made the point that Churchill's comments are having a backlash and where is that backlash going? On to Indian Country. Look, no one believes that he should not have the right to say what he wants. We all believe in the First Amendment even if it is difficult speech. However, just don't run around and claim that you are an Indian when you aren't and that you personally have been oppressed. Let's say that I am a white person that lives in Kentucky and I attend a Baptist church and my parents came the United States from South Africa, do you really believe that I could run around and write books on Irish experience of oppression in Belfast? No. But that is what he is doing. And you are calling it a cheap shot. It is not a cheap shot. It goes to who and what he is. He is what we call in Indian Country a Wannabee. There is a whole tribe of Indians called the Wannabee Indians and he is the Chief. The people that making the complaints about his fake Indian heritage are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination either: Suzan Harjo (worked for Bill Clinton), Dennis Banks (Founder of the American Indian Movement), etc. He can say wherever he wants about 9/11 or America, but he shouldn't lie and claim that he is an Indian when he isn't. And schools like the Univ of Colorado should do a better job of doing there homework when they hire a someone and put out to the world that he is an Indian because he isn't.Keetoowah `

I will look further at what you wrote on my talk page when I get a chance. I am in agreement with your distaste at Ward Churchill putting himself forth as a spokesman for the Native community but even more at those who have accepted him as a spokesman, like the people at the University of Colorado who put him on a fast tenure track, bypassing others, most of whom were not even interviewed. However, judging from his appearance I do think he probably has some Native American ancestory and feel we should take his word for it. The real issues have to do with his actions and ideas.  ::Thank you for the response.  I don't disagree with his right to speak.  I don't agree with a lot he has to say, but that is irrelavant. He does have a First Amendment right to state it.  I just believe that he should be held out as an Indian, when he isn't.  That's all. And I don't believe that we should take his word for itconcerning his alleged Indian heritage.  I know that you have your opinion concerning that and that's fine.  I'm not trying to convince you but it IS an issue for most people in Indian Country.  I forward to your respons.

The question is: Should the title have quotation marks in it?I didn't put them in because it seemed weird, but since the title refers to the words as words rather than their meaning, maybe they should be there.I can't find other article titles that are phrases to act as guidelines, although that's probably just due to lack of imagination on my part. Any thoughts?-  15:04 27 May 2003 (UTC): It won't be an issue like that. You can't have double quotes in article titles. You can have single quotes in a title, but I wouldn't recommend it for this case, just the bare words. Furthermore, I would suggest having the actual article at State motto of New Hampshire, New Hampshire (motto), State motto (New Hampshire), or something like that, and Live free or die as a redirect to that.   15:10 27 May 2003 (UTC):: P.S. Hmm, judging by the single blue link I now see above, it looks as though someone else has pre-emptively disagreed with me, though. ;)   15:12 27 May 2003 (UTC):::There is, it turns out, already a List of state mottos page. I linked to Live Free or die from there. I'm not enthusiastic about titling the article some variant of New Hampshire (motto), since nobody cares about state mottos as such - in this case people are vastly more likely to have heard the phrase and want to find out about it, and IMHO the article title should reflect that approach. But I'm not wedded to the idea, since a search on the phrase would find the article either way   15:25 27 May 2003 (UTC): See Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (slogans), where some discussion/voting on the subject is under way.

Regarding your claim that Hebron is a ``Jewish city`` - as you well know the Jewish community in Hebron has been a minority for hundereds of years. Calling it a Palestinian city makes no judgement on who should live there and who shouldn't because the term ``Palestinian`` is a nationalist term with no direct religious implications. I happen to agree with you that ``The State of Israel does not have the authority to decide what is a Jewish city and what isn't``.

Somebody named dpdsmith took it down and claimed that it was a ``one time only joke mascot created by a campus humor magazine.`` While Keggy the Keg was created by Dartmouth's humor magazine, he is in fact the mascot of Dartmouth College.  Keggy was conceive partially out of the student body’s growing disgust by the ever increasing ineptitude of the current college administration and it’s over zealous attempts to ban and censor anything and everything that could possibly offend anyone. Keggy is by no means a “one time only joke.” He made his debut at the homecoming football game of ’03 and since has attended almost every football game and most hockey games.  Students all over campus can be seen sporting the attractive Keggy T-shirts which depict the lovable fellow drinking from his own tap and have the words “Get Pumped,” and “Go Kegs” written on them.  Further evidence of Keggy’s legitimacy can be seen by that fact that snow sculpture for the most recent Dartmouth Winter Carnival (’05) was an enormous pirate ship which was christened “Captain Keggy’s Carnival Cruiser” by the student assembly.While Keggy may not be recognized as the official mascot by perversely politically correct and out-of-touch-with-reality administrators, Keggy instantly reached iconic status at his first homecoming game, and has since found a permanent place in the hearts of the sons and daughters of Dartmouth.`

0	== Some personal observations here: ==Put a summary of it into the Roots of Christianity; perhaps a whole subsection thereof.  If the Zoroastrianism part is included, then so must the Egyptian especially since the Hebrews were long associated with Egypt back to the Hyksos invasion.  It would be POV to disclude this factor, considering the trail of monotheism left by Akhenaten and adopted by the Hebrews.  I myself don't know much about Zoroaster, but I certainly recognise much of the Egyptian issue and I'm more of a casual researcher.  It seems to me that Zoroastrian elements are tied to the Persian background, but it would be prejudiced to say that the Egyptians have no basis when they long dominated Palestine.  The Greek Pharaoh himself patroned the Septuagint in Alexandria.  I find the bigotry towards an Egyptian root of Christianity to be entirely unfounded when so much of Egyptian culture was adopted by all peoples in a certain radius outwards.  Perhaps this lies in traditional ideas about race; that the Hamites of Africa have not contributed anything and that the Persians supposedly were/are White or considered Japhethic as opposed to the Semites.  Seriously, this Noahidic classification thing is ridiculous because these Afro-Asiatic people are undoubtedly very much alike and most uninvolved observers would say they are less White than the Greeks and Romans.  I consider Persians to be Semites because they are Asian, in this context.  Give it as much credence as the Persian foundations and you will make this NPOV.  I seriously suggest expounding upon both roots of Christianity and also delineating the Greek root which provided Roman impetus for adoption and proliferation.  For instance, if the Greeks hadn't patroned that religious culture as their relation to Philistines, Rome would have dismissed it as everything else in their cultural relationship with Greece.  Rome even rebuilt Greek Philistia as Palestine and during the Catholic Crusades, it became the Kingdom of Jerusalem.  Christianity has so many dimensions, that it would be haughty to overlook its far ranging origins which even has pagan influences from Europe and Buddhist ties in Southwest Asia.  I myself used to be atheist or Odinist not wanting to deal with what I percieved to be other peoples' culture and now I look in wonder at the historical background of the Sea Peoples and the subsequent Graeco-Roman expansion in the Mediterranean Sea.  There are European roots throughout the region now considered Islamic or Arab, but if we don't provide the means for people to see it we will forget it as much as the terrible destruction of the Library of Alexandria.  Just think of the term Indo-European and you will understand Alexander the Great's empire.  See the connection between the European fylfot and Indian swastika or the Cross and the Ankh?  Please don't demolish this magnificent research, for it has been a great boon in my life to know these things.  I am only stating things as I commonly have studied and heard of them.  I do not propose to limit and debar other positions on this issue, therefore I am not endorsing POV.  The various sources I have seen via Google search appear legitimate and/or sometimes biased(as anything!), but it is not my position to judge the appropriateness of the topic.  We are not to cast a POV on the issue in favour or against, just to deliver as any messenger does.  The existing article on the History of Christianity provides the Persian background but does not give adequate coverage of the Egyptian or Hellenic origins, which are quite prominent.  After all, Christianity had most of its evolution in non-Persian areas of the Mediterranean Sea.  Tell me, how many Persian people are prominent in the Christian world throughout its history?  What fractionary comparison can you draw that factually examines the amount and shows a majority of Persian elements in Christianity, compared to the vast amount of Greek specialty(as written, verified and generally known amongst the entire Christian populace) and the nursery of Christianity itself in Egypt via the Old Testament(even Jesus's infancy was spent in Egypt, in safety from Herod!)?  Please, where is the background of Christianity in Persia besides 19th century racial studies?  Like I've said, the Noahide classification thing has been similarly discredited and its density in weight grew most during that era for Indo-Aryan racist theories.

But there's possibly an issue with one of the taggers currently working on the project I wanted to bring to your attention, since you're so involved with it.The description page for an image I posted some time ago showed up in my watchlist today, so I checked it out.  Turns out that a previous vandal had removed my {{GFDL}} tag along with the source info.  That change went unnoticed by me, so it landed in the latest list of untagged images.  Today's change was  putting a {{PD}} tag on it.  Of course, as creator of the image I know for a fact that it is not public domain, and don't see how  could have labeled it as such – {{unverified}}, perhaps, but not {{pd}}. is listed on the untagged images project page.  I looked at this user's contributions, and [s]he is busy tagging away.  But it looks to me like that user is being way too free with {{pd}}. I know for a fact that [s]he tagged my image {{pd}} without cause (didn't even query my user talk page), and others look suspicious, too.  I also see [s]he has tagged images {{unknown}} that should have {{gfdl}} (:Image:Laferteairshow001.jpg),  {{unverified}} that should have {{coatofarms}} (:Image:Villegaignon-crest.gif), and other problems.I left a note on the user's talk page about my map image in particular.  I don't know if you or someone else would want to review this user's tagging contributions and try to educate the user on how to do a better job.  I'd attempt this myself, but, as I said, I'm too busy to contemplate getting into a back-and-forth with someone or going through and retagging all the images [s]he has touched.Thanks for all your great work on this important project and the related image projects!

0	`== Pathetic Motorways, and the ``Walton Summit Motorway`` ==I resent the implication, being the webmaster of the aforementioned site.  The site is not a ``Wacky Website``, but a factually accurate record, with comments tossed in.  You are allowed to educate without boring people, you know!UncleG is proceeding from a false assumption:  that the classification of all motorways is listed on signposts.  There are many other examples of ``unsigned`` motorways where official DfT documentation exists, such as the tiny A635(M) in Manchester or the A14(M) in Cambridgeshire.The Walton Summit Motorway is an extremely unusual case.  Whilst it is quite true that there are many short motorway spurs that are simply a part of the ``parent`` motorway, such as the M1 spur at Luton, the Walton Summit Motorway does not fall into this category.As is clearly pointed out, the Walton Summit Motorway is neither part of the M61, nor part of the M65, but does have motorway classification because it inescapably leads to the roundabout that links the two.  There is no other stretch of motorway in the UK where a short ``spur`` motorway actually links two different motorways.If it is part of the M65, as the ``start of restrictions`` sign at the bottom of the hill implies, then why does the directional flag sign state ``M61 (M65)``, meaning a part of the M61?  This is a common form of signage throughout the UK system, but is unusual to be found upon a motorway.

0	Ignoring the question of how long it will take to actually use it all up, I am prepared to concede the point that if the modern increase rate in CO2 can be extrapolated to burning all known reserves then that would put us at about 700 ppm or less (2.5 times preindustrial levels).  Now, there is a big if in there since we don't really know how existing carbon sinks like soils, forests, and the oceans will respond to increasing CO2.  Right now, these systems buffer the atmosphere so that the annual increase at Mauna Lao is actually significantly lower (by about 50%) than if you just calculate the increase expected from all the CO2 humans dump into the atmosphere.  Basically because CO2 has increased, these systems draw down more CO2 than they did in preindustrial times and hence partially offset our pollution.  Some scientists think this buffer will become ever more effective as CO2 rises, others think it will saturate and a substantially lower fraction of our waste will be absorbed.  Obviously, such uncertainties are important for figuring out max CO2.:::Taking for the moment a value of 700 ppm as a reasonable end point, that still seems potentially bad.  How bad probably depends on how sensitive things like thermohaline circulation are to multiple degree changes in temperature, and how big a feedback is associated with retreating sea ice and permafrost.  Not exactly a risk I am eager to take given existing climate uncertainties.  However, at face value it would seem to take some disasterous scenarios off the table.  For example, it is estimated that the wholesale deglaciation of Antarctica won't occur till 3-3.5 times preindustrial CO2 levels.  (This was presented at a conference of the American Geophysical Union, but I am having trouble finding a reference).:::I think your consideration of how high can CO2 levels really get is a valid one, and potentially very intersting.  However, given the uncertainties involved in such estimates, I would really like to see if we can find something published on the issue.  An academic paper would (hopefully) have spent more time thinking through these issues and work out what kind of a range of values is possible.:::

0	`Calm down, don't exert pressure when you can talk in normal tone.  Anyhow, I did provide evidence, but I guess your idea of evidence is a photograph or a video tape showing Shahrbanoo being dragged on sand by the Arabs.  So Ali knew Persian, eh?  I suppose you have evidence for this?  The page you asked me to click says Ali knew persian and furthermore it quotes a Shia hadith which claims the following masterpiece of comedy::Ali, then came up to the princess and asked: ``What is your name?`` The princess replied: ``The daughter of Jahan-shah``. Ali said: ``and so Shahr-banuyeh you will be called`` (``the bride of the land``).Do you honestly believe that?!  That claim is embarrassingly stupid.  So what evidence you have that Ali knew Persian?  And what evidence you have that Shahrbanoo, who was clearly captured by the Arabs, married Hussayn willingly? Oh, and for your good information, there is plenty of solid historical evidence that her name was Shahrbanoo, and the Arabs didn't gave her that name.  Even if and Arab knew some Persian, what are the chances they knew the difference between the double meaning of ``land/country and city`` for ``shahr``?  At any rate, the Zoroastrians also call her Shahrbanoo, and if her name was given by Ali to her, the Zoros would have referred to her by her original name not by her allegedly Arab given name. Besides, didn't it occur to your brilliant mind that  if Ali was going to give her a name, he would have given her an Islamic name not  a Persian name?   `

0	`If you really beleive all that Shia crap, then good luck to you, cuz you're gonna need it in life.  You don't seem to have a solid grip on reality.  You seem to live in your own world. Anyhow, I will give you a bit of clue free of charge.  The reason there are some favourable Hadiths for Iranians is, surprise surprise, because out of the 6 main Hadith authors, 4 were Iranians, including the 3 most authoritative ones:  Bukhari, Termezi and Hajjaj.  Nasai was also Iranian.  The first 3 were Khurasani, and Nasai was from Pars.  The other 2 Hadith authors are not as major and their works are basically a copy-and-paste from the Hadith of the Iranian authors.  Hajjaj was from Neyshapour but claimed to be of Qushayri origin, so that he was better accepted as some ``real Arab`` from an authentic Arabic origin, but there is academic information that he was indeed of Khorasani origin, and his claim of ``al-Qushayri`` roots is unverifiable.  The most authoritative of the Hadiths is al-Bukhari (from the city of Bukhara).  Having read what you wrote for me, I have reason to believe that someone like you is out of touch with reality and I am not even going to accept an edit war with someone like you. So I let you be happy by deleting the ``forced`` out of the article, and stay happy with your romanticism and keep thinking that Shahrbanoo indeed chose Husayn and they ``lived happily ever after!``, and both Ali and Muhammad knew Persian, and ``Shahrbanoo realized that they had special knowledge``!! hehe no wonder your nation is the way it is today, their ``educated`` people are like you, I can imagine what the uneducated ones are like!!  -)   `

Please keep anything there only to relevant communications.Secondly, El_C has some requests, namely that you try to watch yourself and tone down language that he feels is unduly insulting and offensive. Comments like ``This is BS`` or what have you seem to be what is at issue. While both I and he acknowledge that tempers can run hot in user disputes — I've certainly had my share — such behavior is not conducive to any sort of settlement, and El_C would like that addressed as we proceed through dispute resolution. Perhaps give the Wikipedia:Civility and Wikipedia:Wikiquette articles a once over, although I don't doubt you're well versed in their contents. He and I both just want to keep the amount of personal comments, value judgments, subjective assessments, etc. down to a minimum.Thirdly, I'm posting a request for mediation right after this is complete.

I believe that trolling is an important part of any wiki, and without people who are willing to creatively challenge accepted assumptions and groupthink a community may stagnate or fail to maximise its opportunities. Many people who say they are against 'trolling' are actually, when you talk to them about it, against vandalism, personal attacks or timewasting, none of which I condone. I think that w e need to be more tollerant of different approaches as a community, and more willing to try to understand each other - in that way we can build the best encyclopedia possible.

0	`==Constance Cumbey Update on March 5, 2005 at 10:44 p.m., E.S.T.==Squeakbox's allegations about Nazism and editing a Rastafarian page (to the best of my recollection I have never been to such a page  my knowledge about Squeakbox's Rastafarian sympathies came from his own Wikipedia page)are nothing short of libelous and outrageous.  Obviously he has never read my work.  Most likely he is unfamiliar with the extremely readable and scholarly books of James Webb on occultism, including Nazi permutations of same.  Nazism was clearly based on occultism  evident in every respect from the Thule Society and Theosophical Society roots to the swastika itself.  Hitler did not take his notions from a vaccuum  his notions of ``cleansing actions``, ``master races`` and ``aryanism`` were standard fare in all occult reading  both of Rosicrucians and Theosophists.  As far as left hand swastikas and right hand swastikas are concerned, there are ample books (many of which are in my personal library) showing that it was used interchangeably both ways in both occult and Indian cultures.  The Jews were singled out for hatred in most such literature and still are in the books published by Lucis Trust / Lucis Publishing Company.  Just look at the indexes (and you can do free internet searches):  ``Judaism:  evils of``; ``Judaism, need for dissolution of``.  I have BATTLED Nazism and racism all of my life, starting at age 4 when I told an aunt, ``that man's not bad because he wants to move in your neighborhood.  You're bad because you want to move out just because he's moving in . . .``  Squeakbox owes me an apology.  He confesses he flunked logic.  He also confesses to a closed head injury with a machete type instrument.  For that, I will give him in good Christian style, a charitable interpretation and hope to think that these are his honest interpretations.  Read the New Age books CAREFULLY and not in an altered state  you will find that they are not all peace, light love.  And people who come against them are not ``Nazis``  the kernel of Nazism is the occultism which in its essence spells doom to all who are not blonde, blue-eyed pagans in its ultimate world view.  I have many a New Age book from the early 1980s in my vast personal collection which tells Orientals, Africans, etc., that they should be practicing celibacy as their races are destined to die out anyway.  As regards Solana, he is smart enough to see the Club of Rome agenda for what it clearly is  a global population reduction and occult indoctrination program.  The Club of Rome banner is one that Javier Solana flies the most proudly!`

The theory that the vaccines cause Autism isn't accepted by the scientific community. Some weaknesses of the theory (from Quackwatch.org):# The known number of ASD cases has been increasing since 1979, but there was no jump after the introduction of MMR vaccine in 1988.# Cases vaccinated before 18 months of age had similar ages at diagnosis as did cases who had been vaccinated after 18 months or not vaccinated, indicating that vaccination does not result in earlier expression of autistic characteristics.# At age two years, the MMR vaccination coverage among the ASD cases was nearly identical to coverage in children in the same birth cohorts in the whole region, providing evidence of an overall lack of association with vaccination.# The first diagnosis of autism or initial signs of behavioral regression were not more likely to occur within time periods following vaccination than during other time periods.# A weak statistical association existed between MMR vaccination and initial parental concern, but this appears to have been due to parents' difficulty in recalling precise age at onset and a preference for approximating the age as 18 months.:What seminar did you visit?

Many of those people seem quite content with the fact that they AREN'T part of Los Angeles and are quite happy to remind people as much. They consider it to be a better ``cleaner`` life where they are and wouldn't want to become part of the city of Los Angeles even if given the chance. Beyond that, they simply aren't residents of Los Angeles or the Greater L.A. area even if they proclaim to be, regardless of what any resident or tourist alike would prefer to believe or tell people. By that logic, San Diego residents may as well start calling themselves Los Angeles residents, since San Deigo doesn't take much longer to get to from my house (about 3 hours) than does LAX (which can take 1 and 1/2 to 2 hours to reach in rush hour traffic).`

0	`The following lists the chain of events which led to the inclusion of entities which are not countries to the list. I suppose it takes some detective work to come up with this, although it isnt really that difficult. I leave it up to you guys to interpret the intentions behind this sequence of events:===The old version===As seen in the version timestamped 07:25, 7 Jan 2005 in this page's edit history, the page listed only countries (as commonly accepted to refer to fully independent entities as recognised by the UN), with an opening line which reads:``This is a list of countries that only have a land border with one other country.``===Carbon copy created===On 01:21, 4 Feb 2005, a similarly titled page called List of countries bordering only one country was created by a user named . In the first version of that page, the opening line reads:``This is a list of countries and dependent territories having land border with only one country.Notes:This list includes dependent territories and some disputed or occupied areas that are de facto independent.``Interestingly, that first version includes Hong Kong and Macau as the only two non-independent entities, while Singapore was listed under a classification called ``Arguable``.===Merger?===Within a few hours, the page has evolved to this version at 03:13, 4 Feb 2005. Notably, he copied the introductory text from the first article into his version of the article:``Nations that only share a land border with one other country often have concerns about domination by the other state if it is larger. These can be fears of an outright take-over as has happened historically to such states as East Timor, which was part of Indonesia until very recently, and Ireland, which was part of the United Kingdom until 1921. Today concerns are often about economic domination as with the Canada/United States relationship or the Denmark/Germany one. Because much trade goes over land these countries are often heavily reliant on their single neighbour.``In addition, he added the ``merge`` request with the above page within the same edit.Back in this page, he also added the ``merge`` request at 03:11, 4 Feb 2005===Merged===By 18:57, 7 Feb 2005,  fulfilled the merger request. This effectively places 's introductory paragraph concerning non-independent entities, as well as his entries for these, into that list as can be seen in edit version 19:01, 7 Feb 2005, without  probably suspecting anything unusual.===Contestations===Since this merger, debates over the inclusion of entities which are not countries ensued, unsurprisingly, as we can see above and in the history of edits. It is interesting that  made no mention about the merger process which sparked this discourse. In addition, as we can all see from the above discussions,  was quoted as saying:``They aren't sovereign states, but the same treatment should applies to all lists of countries with the same setting. The notice at the top of the page already tells this list includes not only sovereign states, without any confusions.``It has to be noted, that again he did not mention who was the one who wrote that paragraph, and nor did he mention how it ends up being introduced to this page.===Deductions and comments?===The chain of events as I noted ends here.

I have saved your entire string of correspondence, so have at it!   If I recall correctly, you threatened me with a Honduran jail for ``vandalising Wikipedia`` when I was the one who wrote correctly.  Moreover, I covered Solana's Spanish political career very thoroughly and you falsely accused me of not doing so.  It seems my biggest mistake was once writing ``Ferninand Gonazalez`` instead of ``Felipe Gonzalez`` which would have been a simple edit for you.  Instead, you launched an unseemly internet career of calling me ``a troll`` and a ``vandal`` among other things.  Then you proceeded to ridicule what you perceive as my religious beliefs, while simultaneously confessing to me the past two days (if it wasn't one more blind) your faith in Haile Selassie, the long dead ruler of Ethiopia as God Almighty!  If you want to talk patronizingly about religious beliefs, I could make one fine case out of that, but instead you want to rail and reduce Wikipedia to a Britannica Junior Encyclopedia and below.  Why don't you go pick on someone else!  CONSTANCE.`

Once again I should point out I'm not suggesting we include this whole thing.

0	  I have been giving some thought to the radical criticisms portion of the libertarian article since you first asked.  In part, I think many of these criticisms (at least from anarchists) are already present in wikipedia.  Some are in the anarcho-capitalism article, some are spread across a few other articles, and a few are actually represented in the AC criticisms of non-AC libertarianism.  So once I get around to it I might just throw in a link to another article or part thereof that has these criticisms to avoid redundancy.  Other than that I think the brief arguments outlined already are sufficient, though all of it could use a good round of citations and quotes, which is the pain I've been avoiding.  Anywho, I'll get around to it eventually unless someone beats me to it.

0	`== Wikipedia ``Patricia Cornwell`` page libelous, being used for felony fraud crimes ==The main Wikipedia ``Patricia Cornwell`` page is not only libelous, defamatory, false and misleading, but it is also being used to support felony crimes of fraud and extortion. The page itself is a felony criminal act of obstruction of justice, because it uses the Wikipedia public forum to give a false report of previously committed crimes. Wikipedia contributors may face felony indictment as well as civil charges by maintaining these materials online.Demand is hereby made that you stop these criminal acts on the Wikipedia site, and that you remove the libelous, defamatory, false, fraudulent and misleading material that violates Wikipedia's own policies.The page is the alleged biography page for author Patricia Cornwell, a page which appears to have been seized by partisans under Cornwell's influence or on her payroll. These partisans have authored false and fraudulent material, and reject and delete factual material that displeases Cornwell.I am Patricia Cornwell's leading biographer, and also one of many victims of crimes committed by Cornwell.The Wikipedia main page on Cornwell is a brief piece of pro-Cornwell propaganda, which hides and falsifies her long life of multiple scandals. A large part of the page is a libelous attack on myself, with a criminally fraudulent report of the crimes Cornwell committed against me.As shown in court filings and public documents, Cornwell hired thugs to threaten to have me illegally jailed and murdered, and funded a fraud scheme in a Southern court to try and ban my freedom of speech. Your Wikipedia page falsifies the report of these crimes, and mounts a highly personal libelous attack against me.Patricia Cornwell is a longtime friend of the President Bush family and some FBI agents, and has used these connections to escape prosecution for a series of crimes and offenses, clearly evident in public records and court documents.Your Wikipedia page, seemingly written under the sway of the criminal Cornwell, hides the real facts about her life. A few words of sycophantic praise for Cornwell, and then a brief section on ``Controversies`` which ignores her actual huge history of scandals that is evident from court records and published articles, like when Cornwell was sued for stealing the private autopsy reports of murdered children and copying them nearly verbatim into her novels.You are invited to read Cornwell's genuine biography, widely available online, ``Patricia Cornwell Biography: Crime, Bribery, Scandal and Mental Illness``. Researchers can already have an advance copy of my upcoming biography book on Cornwell, which extensively quotes primary sources and which can background a Wikipedia article to replace the libelous propaganda you have now.It seems the main purpose of your current short Wikipedia Cornwell ``biography`` page is to launch a libelous attack on myself, to try and discredit my work and my upcoming major book on Cornwell.I have tried to begin to edit out the falsehoods and fraudulent statements in your article, but the Cornwell partisans who control the Wikipedia page immediately re-installed the pro-Cornwell lies and libelous propaganda.The specific attacks on me in your Wikipedia article, are direct propaganda in line with Cornwell's hired thugs. Regarding the specifics of these false statements:The article accuses me of making public ``plagiarism`` accusations about Cornwell, regarding a book that she delayed and re-wrote after my private protests. The Wikipedia statements are false, deceptive and misleading. The Wikipedia claims are propaganda, originally laid out by the Cornwell lawyers to set up the lawsuit to ban my freedom of speech, propaganda they set out in a fraudulent article that, as documents show, was planted in the Republican Richmond Times-Dispatch newspaper by the Cornwell lawyers themselves. The Times-Dispatch is a newspaper closely tied to Patricia Cornwell, and the ``reporter`` who wrote the fraudulent article never met me and never interviewed me.The actual facts are that I publicly criticized neo-Nazi activities by Cornwell, her written threats advocating book-burning and the banning of free speech, and her demands that I be totally silent about her. The Cornwell lawyers have tried to pretend that the controversy was instead about accusations of ``plagiarism`` after Cornwell already re-wrote her book, accusations they themselves fabricated to distract from the real issues.The Wikipedia article sneers about the absence of major similarities between Cornwell's book and my earlier novel. But it does not disclose the fact that Cornwell re-wrote and revised her book substantially after my private protests over her announced stor

So I often make no edit summary.Now, if an editor has a dozen messages on their talk page to make edit summaries because they're annoying other editors of the pages they frequent - then I can see why some may object to an adminship request. But if there are no such comments, then where's the problem?

0	`== ``Lab`` created Alexandrite Chrysoberyl ==   Synthetic alexandrite-like sapphires are produced by the Flame-fusion method using Vanadium Oxide as the chromophore or coloring agent. These stones have been manufactured since 1909 and are commonly marketed as a ``substitute,`` for genuine alexandrite chrysoberyl which is vastly more expensive. Experienced gemologists can detect these stones through simple use of magnification which reveals internal curved striae and sometimes gas bubbles which confirms their synthetic origin. The change of color is also unlike genuine or lab-created alexandrite.`

And he feels free to dismiss statements by recognized leaders in cosmology such as George Ellis, first because he is a ``theist`` (Schroeder only wants theistic opinions if they compromise evolution with the Bible or claim that the Bible teaches absolute geocentrism).  Then Schroeder decrees that Ellis, Hubble and Hoyle are extremists, and insists instead that an unnamed ``scientific community`` on whose behalf he speaks says otherwise. `

It is also a statement of fact that all the alleged proofs of geocentrism in the Bible boil down to the same basic thing, words like ``sunset``, which we use today all the time.  And it is common for creationists to discuss the frame of reference when discussing the issue, so this is essential to mention in the interest of fairly representing this viewpoint.

0	== Architectural ==Changed paragraph mentioning that older georgian buildings on campus include pierson and davenport, etc.  As described in Building a University, 1919-1940, a five-part exhibit celebrating the architecture of Yale University, those buildings were actually built by Rogers along with the other residential colleges.  the georgian/gothic differences are for age and stylistic reasons.  Some structures, such as Branford/saybrook and JE, were existing 1920s gothic buildings modified as residential colleges.  The other colleges with gothic exteriors are all visible from Sterling Library and as such are kept in context.  Rather than have a blandly uniform style across the campus (like most of harvard, had to throw that in there) as was originally planned by the university, Rogers used georgian architecture in areas not visible from Sterling. Thus Georgian Dport and TD are actually newer than many of the gothic buildings on campus. On a side note, the limestone portion of saybrook was originally the Sheffield Scientific School.

0	`There are many issues involved here, beyond what any individual might wish to see or not see, and the overall effectiveness, popularity, and usefulness of this project is I believe at stake. The issue of the particular image in question has been closed for the time being, Though curiously it was closed immediately after someone posted a note questioning the claim of its supposed ``free-use`` copyright status, which actually, to my knowledge had not been investigated. It is my understanding that the image is now ``safe`` from further debates about its inclusion for at least a month. I can accept this. I do not in any way accept the idea that the case, or the issues that it raises, are closed, and that myself or anyone should simply ``shut up`` about it. On another issue that my activity has raised: I do generally deplore notifying people of things to which they have not expressed any indications of wanting to be involved with in any way, and whether for commercial, political,  or general social goals I would indeed consider that ``SPAMMING``. I  would prefer to consider what I have done ``targeted campaigning`` upon an issue, in which a very strong and very clear consensus that had been indicated in no uncertain terms was CERTAINLY being ignored and evaded. Very contrary to some people's  assessments and accusations against me, I had NO intentions of keeping my actions secret, nor disguising them in any way. I actually expected people's reactions to them to further publicize the issue in question, and that is exactly what occurred. To the minority of those who I contacted who were in any way offended by my attempts to notify them of what was occurring, I can and will apologize, and I ask their pardon. The responses that were generated would indicate that the majority did not feel that way. What I would consider genuine ``spamming``, or at least the most obnoxious extremes of it, is engaged in by people who are well aware that hundreds or thousands of people will be burdened and offended, for every one who might respond positively to their actions, much like the posters of these photographs, which most people DO classify as hardcore pornography, normally limited to ADULTS, including the providers of the images. From the main page of their site I have extracted these quotations (``bolding`` mine): :See our site review in Jane's Sex Guide HornyBoy was rated ``Quality and Original porn``.

0	`== Text removed ==In an appearance on ABC News's Nightline on March 15, 2005, Michael Schiavo cited the willingness that Mrs. Schiavo's parents expressed to keep her alive by any means necessary, including quadruple amputation if needed, as a key reason for denying transfer of guardianship to them. :No, the transcript does not say that.  Schiavo makes it quite clear that it has nothing to do with the Schindlers.   SCHIAVO: If I moved on with my life — and I moved on with a portion of it — but I still have a big commitment to Terri. I made her a promise...And another reason why I won't give Terri back is that Mr. Schindler testified in court, at the 2000 trial, that he would — to keep Terri alive he would cut her arms and legs off and put her on a ventilator just to keep her alive...It's not about the money. This is about Terri. It's not about the Schindlers, it's not about the legislators, it's not about me, it's about what Terri Schiavo wanted. I am in the process of tracking down this testimony, as I recall reading parts of it in another article.   |  ::Ok, here it is, from the December 2003 report to Governor Bush by Dr. Jay Wolfson from the University of South Florida::::Testimony provided by members of the Schindler family included very personal statements about their desire and intention to ensure that Theresa remain alive.  Throughout the course of the litigation, deposition and trial testimony by members of the Schindler family voiced the disturbing belief that they would keep Theresa alive at any and all costs.  Nearly gruesome examples were given, eliciting agreement by family members that in the event Theresa should contract diabetes and subsequent gangrene in each of her limbs, they would agree to amputate each limb, and would then, were she to be diagnosed with heart disease, perform open heart surgery.  There was additional, difficult testimony that appeared to establish that despite the sad and undesirable condition of Theresa, the parents still derived joy from having her alive, even if Theresa might not be at all aware of her environment given the persistent vegetative state.  'Within the testimony, as part of the hypotheticals presented, Schindler family members stated that even if Theresa had told them of her intention to have artificial nutrition withdrawn, they would not do it. Throughout this painful and difficult trial, the family acknowledged that Theresa was in a diagnosed persistent vegetative state.  |  :::: Uhm, how does Mr. Schindler saying that he would cut her arms and legs off not represent that statement? I'm not understanding where your quibble is... the testimony? The statement about amputation? ``a`` key reason vs. ``the`` key reason? Please explain why you removed the text, as I'm not seeing a clear explanation.  :::::The editor wrote that the statement in question was a key reason for denying transfer of guardianship to them.  The transcript does not say that.  If anything, Schiavo makes it clear that this is one reason directly connected to the Schindler's inability (probably for religious reasons) to respect Terri's wishes.  The quote in Wolfson's report makes that clear, but Schiavo only alludes to the testimony in the transcript.  Also, Michael Schiavo further clarifies in the transcript that this is not about what he wants, but about what Terri Schiavo wanted.  The statement that was removed from the article attempted to distort these facts.  Further, the statement by the Schindlers has been put to rest on page 34 of Wolfson's report:Of the Schindlers, there has evolved the unfortunate and inaccurate perception that they will ``keep Theresa alive at any and all costs`` even if that were to result in her limbs being amputated and additional, complex surgical and medical interventions being performed, and even if Theresa had expressly indicated her intention not to be so maintained. During the course of the GAL's [Guardian Ad Litem] investigation, the Schindlers allow that this is not accurate, and that they never intended to imply a gruesome maintenance of Theresa at all costs.   |  :::::: Re-added text, with efforts to manage such issues, feel free to adjust as needed!  ::::::With respect to the statement that Michael Schiavo said in a transcript that ``this`` (ending her life) ``is not about what he wants, but about what Terri Schiavo wanted,`` it is important to note that he said exactly the opposite in a sworn deposit
0	My position is that the assumption that C14 levels have been fairly constant is a reasonable starting base for dating items.  However, this assumption is not necessary because of the existance of calibration curves.  Basically, we get almost the same namers from calibration curves that we get from just assuming that C14 levels have been constant for the last 10,000 years.  We have two independent ways of getting at the same data.  The chances of both methods giving us mostly the same data by pure chance is really small.

0	:I was just about to do the redirect as you suggested, but then it occured to me that the first page (LTS Railway) is more about the history of the company pre-grouping, while my page (LTS Line) is more about the line's route and operations today (cf. South Eastern Railway vs Chatham Main Line). I'm willing to merge the articles together, but would prefer that there were two seperate articles - if you look at other articles on Template:Britishmainlines then most are route descriptions rather than the history of companies.

0	`NOTBELOW IS ANOTHER OF SQUEAKBOX'S LIES AND MISREPRESENTATIONS:  I have absolutely no control over what others put on their board.  What Mr. Van Nattan writes are his own thoughts.  My book was the standard reference of the 1980s on the New Age Movement.  I disagree with Mr. Van Nattan on many items, including what I consider Catholic bashing.  For anything written by him to be imputed to me is untrue and unfair.  This is as logical as SqueakBox imputing to me every IP address disagreeing with SqueakBox from anywhere in Michigan (i.e. Allen Park, Michigan, where I have probably been maybe 3 to 4 times in my career as a lawyer and no other contact  certainly I have no IP address emanating from Allen Park, Michigan.  The Detroit metropolitan area has at least 3.5 million residents.  Equally ridiciulous is imputation to me of things fro Reston, Virgina, and his biggest stretch was that if it came from Toronto, it had to be Cumbey as that is ``so close to Detroit``.  Clearly his major was not USA geography.  As far as ``original research``  my research on Solana was all culled and distilled from other works.  Synthesizing this is what encyclopedic research is about.  I don't know what SqueakBox is talking about as original research.  Does he mean I went to Solana's house and office and took physical measurements.  This is idiotic and he has turned Wikipedia into an idiotic circus.  I'm happy that he has nothing better to do with HIS time.  As for me, I must practice law for an honest living!`

0	If you have any idea of what Blank's Pond is, you know what I mean by sewage accumulation pond. All it is is a muddy puddle about 5 feet wide and 10 feet long. Maybe it was once used for ecological studies, but not in 10 years. Many parts of the original article drastically misrepresent what TAS is. There is no olympic sized swimming pool, the library is not close to rivaling that of a small liberal arts college. I just come to spread the truth.Allentchang, the point is that there are a rather large number of crimes at TAS versus the rest of the Taiwanese schools and it has often been the subject of Taiwanese media. I don't see how you can deny that. Yes, a lot of students go to the UC system, but that doesn't really say a lot, considering how poor the American education system is compared to the Taiwanese one.

Nintendo didn't (to my knowledge) change Gannon, Rupy, Rupies, etc. etc. etc. nor did they correct the Old man's tentative grasp of the English language. Now I'm not going to revert it (well, I don't have the power to, but that's not the point!), but I don't think this is really ``true`` as such, judging by the other errors still featured in the game.

I simply state that most people believe .... and that these things happened. i don't say its good or bad, why do you think i am not NPOV. sure if you want to nitpick you can see some words that maybe be of negative tone, but i do not believe i am more judgemental than other authors. this ban should be removed and my posts should be reinstated in the name of a neutral, uncensored encyclopedia.  
0	btw there needs to be some serious fact checking on some claims such as.. does blank;s pond actually even exist anymore, or did people realize it was a mud puddle full of shit and fill it up a long time ago. Is TAS really non-profit>? NO! The college acceptance rate for the graduating class has always been above ninety percent.what does this mean? people from TAS get accepted 90% of the time? NO!Seriously, the censorship needs to go away. we've seen that TAS has sports facilities and a hot meal line. we also want to see what the taiwanese people feel about TAS because that is an important part of what TAS is. we need to publish the incidents that are so important to TAS. juz cuz you think it givves TAS a bad name doesn't mean that it shouldn't be published. if its true, then fuck, let there be light. this censorship shit is really really gay.  
0	:Oh, and incidentally, the Wikipedia guidelines for American vs British English say to use whichever is either most predominant in Wikipedia, or what applies best to the article or what the article is written in, in order of ascending priority.  Wikipedia is largely in American English, Gnome is an American project, and reading through the article, the only thing that I can find that is British English and not American, is precisely the word we are quarrelling over.  So I think I can safely say it should be 'organization', not 'organisation'. But I don't want a revert war, so I'm gonna drop it until I hear from you. 'Course, we could always go to arbitration...

0	`==Concerns over Tom Walker==A full two paragraphs is spent discussing Tom Walker's ``rebutal`` of the relatively common position that work-week restrictions are not effective against unemployment.  I was instantly left wondering, who is Tom Walker.   Tom walker turns out to be a social policy activist   (Yes, I'm pretty sure I have the right Tom Walker).  His rebutal has not to my knowledge been published in a peer reviewed journaland my opinion, as a PhD candidate, is that it is riddled with enough errors of logic as to not even merit consideration as reasonable dissent.  Unfortunately, Mr. Walker is so obscure, I can't find anyone who has taken the time to critique him in a peer reviewed journal eitherwhich isn't surprising given that his paper was never published in an accepted journal.  As much as I'd like to include some real argument against the commonly held position of economists, I don't think this Tom Walker stuff passes muster to merit inclusion.  I intend to delete the paragraphs relating to him.  I invite people to come forward with information suggesting that* Tom Walker is actually a figure of merit, qualified to have so much prominence in this article.* has published his rebutal in a generally accepted peer reviewed journalAlso, if people have any replacement suggestions.  Please speak-up.   `

0	`==One-sided debate?==I would like to engage Pollinator on his claims that I am ``rewriting`` my opponents viewpoints. The following things should be considered: 1) Wikipedia has one viewpoint, that of an encyclopedia. No part of no article can be said to be off-limits to editting.2) I have tried to be reasonable with Ungtss (the editor of the article who is trying to impose his own POV). As it currently stands he wants to have a ``counterpoint`` defense against the criticisms section. This is unacceptable because there will be no end to the point-counterpoint style of an article. If he wants to make points, let him do it in the article itself.3) Two of the arguments are not only specious, they're based on poor research on the part of Ungtss. I have explained this all above.Therefore, it is unreasonable for you to revert the edit which has added quality to the page.  `

They apparently lived on Earth for a time, but left after 'seeding' the planet with life that would evolve into humans. The series seems to indicate that the ancients were a galactic civilization that had colonies all over the Milky Way Galaxy. Then a plague struck them, and their population was decimated. The remaining ancients set out to repopulate their kind by 'seeding' worlds that could support life. Earth was the last of these worlds in the Milky Way galaxy that was 'seeded' before the ancients left for the Pegasus galaxy to continue their work.

My father was an eyewitness to some of the atrocious war crimes committed in Singapore by the Japanese army and it haunts him to this very day. I cannot believe that due to Japanese economic power, both British and Americans call the Japanese War Crimes ``biased``, as if these were only one point of view. Worse still, the page on Nagasaki does not fully highly the effects of the Nagasaki bombings on Japanese children who were born malformed even many decades later.

0	`== Movie reviews and POV ==(I posted this on TheGrza's talk page and am also posting it here as it deals with some of the issues you raise)::`` The POV is inherent in these type of reviews the same way Christian reviews are bound by their ideology instead of actually critiquing a film``TheGrza, I think you misunderstand our POV policy which applies to the content of the articles only, not to external links. First of all if we did not allow POV in external links we'd have to remove half the external links in Wikipedia. Secondly, all film reviews are, by definition, POV (I don't know of any reviews that don't express an opinion) so we'd have to remove all links to film reviews if NPOV applied to external links. We don't remove links simply because of the politics of the site linked to. I think you also misunderstand the concept of ``vandalism``. We can't simply throw around the term to justify removal of any material we don't like. It applies specifically to activity that disrupts wikipedia or disrupts an article. I've seen MIM reviews quoted in Harper's so they are actually relatively well known if only for their amusement value. There is no reason why we shouldn't have external links to Christian film reviews or Marxist film reviews. A broad variety of links is encouraged. What's discouraged are repetitive links to similar material (eg reviews from a dozen daily newspapers would be repetitive). As to your point about ideology, I don't know if you've ever studied film theory in university or read academic journals on film such as cahiers des cinema but serious film criticism does actually deal with ideology, subtext etc and is not just the ``thumbs up`` ``thumbs down`` type review you see in a newspaper. By your argument we couldn't link to serious scholarly articles on films, many of which ``deconstruct`` films from a Marxist, feminist, postmodern, or other ideological perspective. For instance, Susan Sontag's important and influential writings on film would be banned, by your argument, as they are ideological in nature and explore the subtext of films rather than simply being a technical critique. Hope this clarifies things.  ::Specifically to Curps, while I agree that linking to hundreds of mainstream reviews would be repetitive I see no problem with listing to a variety of reviews from different mainstream and non-mainstream viewpoints. Whether or not a review is listed on ``Rotten Tomatoes`` is not really relevent as that site really only deals with popular mainstream reviews. Indeed, by your criteria we could not link to serious scholarly critiques of films carried in scholarly journals. We do not determine the worthiness of links by how mainstream or popular they are. Rather we look for diversity of opinions in our links.  `

0	== Rewrite of the article ==I have decided to insert a version of the equivalence principle article. The   main goal is to have an article that is in conformance with the wikipedia article on gravity. A lot of what I write is derived from that article. The basis of the equivalence principle is Einstein's 1907 vision that gravitational interaction is mediated by changing the rate of time, by curving space-time geometry. Then and only then can the effects of acceleration cancel the effects of gravitation. Everything else follows from that. Every interaction has a mediator. In the case of gravitation curvature of space-time is that mediator.  |

0	:ok, I put some info. there 
0	`: I agree that some of the examples here are somewhat fluffy.  But emergence means slightly different things in different fields.  For example, while physicists use the term emergence, it doesn't have the same hype attached to it as the term does in the behavioural sciences.  It's simply used to mean a phenomenon or concept which only makes sense, or behaves in an expected way, at macroscopic scales (in space or time) but not at microscopic scales.  Thus questions like ``is this electron hot or cold?  blue or green?  soft or hard?  smooth or rough?  solid or liquid?`` have little or no useful meaning, because these concepts are emergent and thus do not apply in this setting (or if they do apply, they behave unexpectedly and so one's intuition on the concept may be very misleading here).  That's a helpful thing to keep in mind, it lets one avoid any number of elementary errors when trying to understand particle physics, and thus does have a non-trivial amount of explanatory power.  As for mathematics (which is my own profession), I've almost never seen the term ``emergence`` used... the closest analogues seem to be the distinction between ``local`` and ``non-local`` (or ``global``) concepts, or between ``asymptotic`` and ``non-asymptotic`` behaviour.  It is true, I would classify most of the mathematical examples here as examples of non-local concepts rather than emergent ones.  If I have some time I might try to rework some of the mathematical material (which I was not involved in earlier).   `
0	Hi Why is this page being deleted
0	I hate to disagree with you Ran but that is completely incorrect, the Chinese vernaculars did not start shifting at that time. You can do more research by looking up Middle Chinese and Classical Chinese. The Mandarin never altered the King sound to Jing sound as quickly as that. Most of the colonial invasion came from the Southern Coasts in those days, thus, they romanised from Cantonese and Minnan. Kirin is romanised according to the dialect around Jilin at a different stage that is why it is not calle Katlam. By the way, you are really offensive by blocking me yesterday. You did not read the regulations on Wikipedia that you are not supposed to call users who are newbies Vandals. That is an abuse of your privilege. I notice a lot of experienced editors here who like to block and delete the text contributions of newbies are really mean. Why are educated people so mean? This is a free world and we all have a privilege to speak out part but should also listen to others and not be so quick to censor others.
0	== Vandalism Policy ==Hey RanPerhaps you should re-read this paragraph. Do not impose your deletions on anymore newbies. That will discourage people from contributing to this site, especially vital for non-Chinese speakers learning about Chinese culture. If you like dominating viewpoints, fine, but you are welcome to write and publish your own book or even your own website. Thank you. Good luck.NPOV violations The neutral point of view is a difficult policy for many of us to understand, and even Wikipedia veterans occasionally accidentally introduce material which is non-ideal from an NPOV perspective. Indeed, we are all blinded by our beliefs to a greater or lesser extent. == While regrettable, this is not vandalism ==. See also: NPOV dispute.
0	Whether it is innovative or not is in itself controversial. POV.
0	I know what Ran is saying and though Ran has been quite annoying to me, Ran is right in this. Mandarin is a group of dialects in itself i.e. Mandarin in itself is French in Paris, French in Avignon with thick Italian accent and French with the Quebecois accent whereas Standard Mandarin is BBC Received Pronuciation of English, no one's mother tongue but it is a Received Standard.However, I see the frustration with this categories too. I think it is best to translate beifanghua literally as Northern Speech (Mandarin dialects) . Putonghua as Common Speech (Mandarin-Received Pronunciation), Guoyu as National Language (Mandarin-Received Pronunciation), Beijinghua or Jingyu as Beijing Speech or Imperial Tongue (Mandarin, prestige-variant).
0	.It is Nanking and Peking, not Pakking and Namking because you are confusing these early romanisations with the Jyut Ping which is a later linguistic invention. They are also not all romanised according to English. The British invaders came the last. They were first romanised by an Italian Missionary called Ricci and then by the French missionaries. That is why Guangdong is written as Canton. Canton was never meant to be an English romanisation. If you pronounce it in French, it sound exactly like the Cantonese pronunciation of it, even today. Same thing for Peking and Nanking. When you pronounce them in French, Italian, they sound more like the original Cantonese vernacular variant. Do not be so quick to dismiss what you do not know or understand because one day when you need someone to understand you when you are old ugly and lonely, others will also dismiss you in the same way

0	== Header enforcement ==I wouldn't know exactly what percentage of likeness that must hold to delete a comment that has been altered.  It's actually easier to just ensure that the bot itself tries to avoid inserting the comment twice.  I could have the bot make a special pass to do that... but how I dealt with it on the other pages was that I didn't care since the bot would empty the sandbox and rake it clean.  In the case of the Introduction page, I can have the sandbox rake it of similar-like comments...  I would need some idea what I'm looking for really, it would be slightly difficult to do... just a lot of regular expression matching.

0	?I also need help uploading this picture that I don't know how to dohttp://www.talentondisplay.com/girls/JadinWong.jpg
0	I agree with you. I am a Chinese contributor to this site and I speak 3 Chinese vernaculars and 3 European languages and through some of the unreasonable Mandarinization imposed here, I feel how repressed non-native Mandarin speakers are by those apparently native speakers. Traditionally, foreign names are transliterated into Chinese ideographs by whichever vernacular group that first settled there. In USA and Europe, it is mostly by the Cantonese, then subsequently The Minnan-Taiwanese and recently the people for Fuzhou, Wenzhou etc. As such, they will use Han ideographs to represent the sounds they transliterate from the foreign language like English. There is no standardised version until the Northerners came into power and imposed Mandarin on all the other Chinese groups for the noble mission of reuniting the motherland against foreign invaders through bettering communication. I think the best way to transliterate and reflect the diversity of Chinese culture is to put the actual foreign name first, i.e. the ORIGINAL, followed by the oldest transliteration (in chronology) and finally the Mandarin version. That will make it easy for everyone cos then the eyes will zoom right to the end for the contemporary Mandarin pronunciation and zoom right to the first line for the original and if readers have time, they can trace the colorful history of transliteration and migration by reading the chronology of changes. Thank you for being so interested in Chinese culture. We need more friends like you. Have a nice day.
0	other people'sGosh you can't even speak English which you claim to be your mother tongue. Puh-lease.
0	Hello RanThanks for the comprehensive message justifying your pride in the Northern China. I find all your articles on China very selective and BIASED and your block people whose opinions and facts of China confirm otherwise. I won't block you because I am better than that. This is the EXACT SAME KIND OF MANDARIN CHAUVINISM that has MASSACRED many intellectuals on the Mainland through brute force. I must say that it is disgusting. You do not represent Chinese people and the facts that you substantiate are paramount to propaganda. Stop posting messages on your site and I won't do the same to you. I am not interested in your pages. Thank you very much.

0	`Many see the rise in Western Europe of what they call the ``new anti-Semitism`` as even more worrisome. Since serious Israeli-Palestinian fighting began in the fall of 2000, there has been a spike in harassment and vandalism targeting Jews, especially in France. Much of that is in poor communities where immigrant Muslims and immigrant Jews from North Africa live side by side. Unemployment and frustrations are high. Arab satellite stations, as well as European news networks, broadcast a steady stream of reports on Palestinians under fire, their homes destroyed, their lands reoccupied, their children killed. There is also, in many parts of Europe, a residue of the old racist attitudes that spawned the Fascist and Nazi policies of the 1930s. One of the presidential candidates in France's upcoming elections, Jean-Marie Le Pen, skirts the limits of the law baiting both Arabs and Jews...`

0	:From Nuclear explosion:::In 1945 there was some initial speculation among the scientists developing the first nuclear weapons that there might be a possibility of igniting the earth's atmosphere with a large enough nuclear explosion. This would concern a nuclear reaction of two nitrogen atoms forming a carbon and an oxygen atom, with release of energy. This energy would heat up the remaining nitrogen enough to keep the reaction going until all nitrogen were finished. This was, however, quickly shown to be unlikely enough to be considered impossible . Nevertheless, the notion has persisted as a rumor for many years.

In this constituency unemployment is very low, and home ownership is high, all of which helps Labour and the Conservatives who were the top two parties in the constituency in 2001, both exhibiting positive swings while the Lib Dems lost votes. This is an obvious Tory hold. Nevertheless, good luck Mr Tod.

If we say that comics is a medium, do we mean that comics is a sort of generic name for all the physical mediums (comic books, web comics, ...) ?

0	Link right here, Yuber: Egypt authorizes force to police 'unuthorized' Islamic tracts. Yes, they have more limited range (thankfully) than the Saudi Mutaween, no doubt due to Egypt's own issues in policing groups like the Muslim Brotherhood.

0	Eagle, he's just a POV pusher. He was trying to strip the information out of the article, and started chain-reverting in order to do it. He's STILL lying and saying that the only Muslim nations with religious police are Saudi Arabia and Iran. Either he's just willfully ignorant or he is deliberately trying to push a very specific POV, and he seems not to care at all about facts. 
0	`::::::You have YET to explain what about the phrase ``and in varying forms in other Muslim countries`` you find objectionable, POV pusher. .`
0	`::::::I'm not sure the etymology of the word has much to do with it; the idea of religious police is pretty common on one level or another in almost all Islamic countries. It takes various forms depending on what the government decides to do, naturally; the more religious-theocratic the government, the more likely it'll be a full branch of the police or even its own group. Take its incarnation in Saudi Arabia and compare it to the village enforcement groups found in northern Pakistani villages, for instance. Or the versions in Egypt and Yemen, which have (at least at this point) more to do about making sure that the only version of Islam practiced is the state-sponsored one. Overall, the fact remains that MANY Islamic nations have religious police of some form or another, and leaving out the fact that it is NOT an institution unique to Saudi Arabia is inaccurate, as is claiming that it ``only`` exists in Saudi Arabia and Iran. `

0	Another comment: Vilnius, Gardinas and Lyda, are official names of cities of Vilnius region; by this time official names already should be used, same as you use Wilno, Grodno, etc. for Polish cities. Vilnius region, when mentioned in this context, in generally means territory of Lithuania, therefore Lithuanian names should be used. Wilno Voivodship is territory of Poland, so it's cities might be named in Polish if there'd be list. You can write more in supposedly oversimplified parts.

And because at the moment there will still be many people who want to look that up I quickly reverted the change. The problem is that, as I understand it, before seeing the preview in this page, the Template:Election_Summary_Party first needs to be changed - really changed, not just a preview. What I did was addalign=``right`` |  |afteralign=``center`` |  |Then I changed the entries in the table, for example for the first one (Labour) I added|%          = 55.2after the seats-entry (see below for a more complete example (that one's for an extra row)). But that didn't work. I suppose I need to alter another template, but I don't know how and I don't have the time now to research this. Hopefully someone else can do this in a whiffy. Or is there an easy explanation?Here are the percentages:Labour Party (UK)  55.2Conservative Party (UK) 30.5Liberal Democrats (UK) 9.6United Kingdom Independence Party 0Scottish National Party 0.9Green Party of England and Wales 0Democratic Unionist Party 1.4British National Party 0Plaid Cymru 0.5Sinn Féin 0.8Ulster Unionist Party 0.2Social Democratic and Labour Party 0.5RESPECT The Unity Coalition 0.2Scottish Socialist Party 0Veritas (political party) 0Alliance Party of Northern Ireland 0Scottish Green Party 0Peter Law 0.2Socialist Labour Party (UK) 0Liberal Party (UK, 1989) 0Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern 0.2Socialist Green Unity Coalition 0Notice that the discrepancies between the percentages for number of votes and number of seats is often quite substantial. For example, the Labour party got 35 % of the votes but 55 % of the seats (mostly at the expense of the Liberal Democrats). Quite a difference! Especially since this means an absolute majority in parliament. That is what I was mostly interrested in when I came to this article. But that info wasn't there, so I had to do the calculations myself. And having done that I thought I might as well add it to the table. It is too important a thing not to point out.To do the calculations I had to add the figures up. Having done that I thought I might as well add that to the table too, but I already got stuck with the first bit. Only the totals for the number of seats and votes make sense, but what I had in mind was this:  |party      = TOTAL  |seats      = 645  |%          = 100  |gain       = -  |loss       = -  |net        = -  |votes      = 26,913,618  |%          = 100  |plus/minus = - 12:08, 2005 May 13 (UTC)`
0	Update:  May 13, 2005:  SqueakBox has made damaging inferential admissions on my own blogspot, www.cumbey.blogspot.com that he fabricated items in various stories he has composed about Javier Solana either here or on his various other internet stalkings seeking to erase all negative references to Javier Solana on the whole worldwide web (a daunting and challenging task!).  He now admits he invented the story about Solana being considered the friendliest child in his grade school class.  I was quite surprised to learn this as I honestly thought maybe SqueakBox had information which could be useful to me in the book I am writing about Javier Solana as well as my Wikipedia contributions and blogspot articles.  I asked him for his source and he publicly posted that he got it from the same place as I got that Ariel Sharon refused to meet with Solana.  The problem with this is that Ariel Sharon really did refuse to meet with Javier Solana and SqueakBox deleted that reference from Wikipedia and defamed me all over the web by falsely claiming I had fabricated that information.  What was fabricated was Squeakbox's claim that the evidence (and website links were posted at the time) did not exist.  J'accuse SqueakBox of intellectual dishonesty to the detriment of Wikipedia and I will be seeking to have him permanently banned from Wikipedia.  Below are just a few of many links proving that contrary to SqueakBox's bold assertions, Ariel Sharon refused to meet with Solana in July 2004!

0	`By the grace of G-dShalom everyone!The category ``Noahide Religions`` is extreemly misleading Rambam doesn't say Muslims are Noahide just not idolworshipers.A Noahide (Ben Noah, Chasid Umot haOilam) according to Rambam and others is someone who officialy accepts the 7 Laws and observes them.According to letters of the Rambam Islam is herecy, a false religion started by a false prophet:Mohammed the False Prophet - Islam the False ReligionRivka Olenick ``A prophet will the Lord, thy God raise unto thee, a prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren.`` Deuteronomy 18:15 The false prophet, the navi sheker, the ``madman`` Mohammed, as the Rambam calls him, convinced his followers of Islam that there are several verses in our scriptures that allude to his being a prophet. The Rambam states: ``These arguments have been rehearsed so often that they have become nauseating. It is not enough to declare that they are altogether feeble; to cite as proofs these verses is ridiculous and absurd in the extreme. Neither the untutored multitude nor the apostates themselves who delude others with them believe in them or entertain any illusion about them. Their purpose in citing these verses is to win favor in the eyes of the Gentiles by demonstrating that they believe the statement of the Koran that Mohammed was mentioned in the Torah. The Muslims themselves put no faith in their arguments, they neither accept nor cite them, because they are manifestly so falicious.`` Mohammed claimed that Deuteronomy 18:15 specifically refers to him. He said that it was he who God arose as ``a prophet from the midst of thee.`` Of course, he himself nor anyone else ever found one word in the scriptures that proved that Mohammed arose as a prophet. Yet, he and his blind followers accuse us of manipulating the text of the Torah. They ignorantly claim that we purposely removed every trace of the name of Mohammed from it. However it was they that would not accept the main precepts of the Torah, out of defiance to the Revelation at Sinai. So in great desperation they created a book that horrendously warps and taints our scriptures and undermines Moses as the greatest Prophet. After all this they attempted to legitimize the Koran as a book of truth. Isn't it amazing that exactly what they accuse us of - ``altering`` the Torah text - is exactly what they altered when they made up this ``imitation`` and called it the Koran. What they believe is so obviously false, yet the world is convinced that this is a book of truth only because of the vast numbers who read it, and not because it contains any real truth. The Rambam says: ``Therefore, all the nations instigated by envy and impiety rose up against us, and all the kings of the earth motivated by injustice and enmity applied themselves to persecute us.`` There arose a new sect, which combined the two methods of conquest and controversy, into one, because it believed that this procedure would be more effective in wiping out every trace of the Jewish nation and religion. They claimed to prophecy and found a new faith, Islam, contrary to the Divine religion and to contend that it was equally God given. Thereby it hoped to raise doubts and create confusion, since one is opposed to the other and both supposedly emanate from a Divine source, which would lead to the destruction of both religions. For such a remarkable plan contrived by a man who is envious and querulous. He will strive to kill his enemy and to save his own life, but when he finds it impossible to attain his objective, he will devise a scheme whereby they both will be slain.`` He slays them both because he really knows that he cannot destroy God, but he cannot tolerate God's Divine word and so out of his own insanity he kills those who represent God and kills himself believing he will enter paradise. The Torah states that the prophet that will arrive ``from the midst of thee`` is a person that will keep the Torah in tact as it was given to us by Moses from God. The Ninth Principle of our Thirteen Principles of Faith states: ``I believe with perfect faith that the Torah will not be changed, and that there will never be another Torah given by God.`` As it says: ``Thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.`` Deuteronomy 13:1. ``A prophet will the Lord thy God raise unto thee, from the midst of thee, of thy brethren.`` Islam took this sentence completely out of context and made inferences. All the statements before and after must be understood so that the meaning and purpose of the statements is known. The sentence quoted above was taken from a paragraph in Deuteronomy that specifically warns the Jewish people about the prohibitions of soothsaying, astrology, divination, sorcery, etc. The Gentiles believe they can manipulate and use these practices in ord

0	`::Yes, I agree wholeheartedly with that. I'm from Amsterdam, The Netherlands, myself. I've been in France and other European countries back in the disco era, and what we call ``disco`` is encompassing much more than what is being made of it here. For instance, loads of really good disco music was made in Italy, Germany, France and even here in The Netherlands, because there was a lot of money in mafia to buy the early synthesizers. Moroder, for one, was an Italian living in Munich when the Donna Summer hits were created I believe. Disco to us here therefore also includes music by Gino Soccio, Cowley, Moroder himself (not only his Donna Summer work) plus many Italian producers. When I see this page, it's as if Europe didn't influence the genre, while it is the other way around in many ways. It wasn't Chicago or London where house-music started, even, the first fast-paced housey acidy music came from Italy, Germany and The Netherlands if you ask me. Take for example 'Remember' by Vivien Vee from 1977, and 'Crazy Family' by Jock Hattle, the long version from 1982. They both have long-lasting breaks in them, perfect examples of disco that would now be called ``house`` or maybe even ``trance`` for parts of them.`

0	`:Thanks Tom - that's a much better summary than the previous one. One question: in the comparison of UKIP's performance to that of other parties, I think saying that the SNP polled less than UKIP could be misleading for non-UK readers. If I didn't know that the SNP only stood candidates in Scotland, I'd get the impression from the current text that UKIP did much better than the SNP on average. But knowing that UKIP put up candidates across the country (while the SNP didn't) gives quite a different impression, since, of course, the SNP polled much better than UKIP everywhere it put up candidates. So for the benefit of non-UK readers, in the section comparing UKIP's performance to that of the Lib Dems and SNP, perhaps it might be helpful to add ``ahead of the Scottish National Party (who only contested seats in Scotland)``?:I won't make that addition unless you approve, though.:Oh, one more thing - do we have a quote from a UKIP official or UKIP press release on the official reaction to the election result, or a link to an article about it?

The old UM link is actually the parent link (with other useful links embedded) of the one you put in. The Yahoo link seems to me to be basically a search engine result, but in any event, most or all of the links are already in the article, thus it seems duplicative to me.Although they don't show up in the article, I merely remarked them out (and moved the UM and AbstractAppeal links up to the Compilations section) just in case a consensus decides that they should remain or supercede the originals (especially with that rigorously formal biblio-style—is that APA?), or be 86ed.The link to Eric Zorn's collection used to be in the article but got discarded somewhere along the line.

0	`::::I considered changing ``evolution`` in the article to ``natural selection``, but after reading Evolution I think that would be inappropriate. When scientists speak of ``the theory of evolution``, they mean the general idea that all species on the planet descend from a common ancestor, and arise through descent with modification. They do indeed disagree on the source of the modifications, and the mechanisms of selection, but the general idea itself is sufficently precise and falsifiable that it can be considered a theory in its own right. Any of the following would cause great trouble for evolution:::::* Different species having completely different biochemistry::::* Different species having completely different genetic mechanisms::::* Different species sharing no genetic code::::* The fossil record showing that there has been no trend from lesser to greater complexity over time::::But as you know, the evidence in all these areas has consistently shown the opposite, and no other theory has come remotely close to giving an alternative. This is why so many scientists believe that evolution is in the same league as, say, heliocentric theory. – \ `

0	I don't object to characterizing International Third Position as neofascist or a form of national socialism and think those are accurate terms for the group.  What I was objecting to was (1) the characterizing of International Third Position as part of the Third Way (UK) political party, which is factually inaccurate as they are two different groups; and (2) the characterization of Third Way (UK) as right-wing or neofascist in any sense.  What we have here are two groups which resulted from a split in the British National Front in the 1980s, but that's the only connection.  International Third Position still follows right-wing Strasserite ideology, Third Way (UK) has become essentially a group of the left and its leadership has renounced racism and fascism.  Barring any evidence to the contrary, I'll take their word for it.

It is proper politic for her to be addressed as such. If the President of the USA can refer to her as ``Your Majesty`` surely it is acceptable for an online encyclopedia to do so.`
0	`::yes, you made that clear, but I still find your reasoning bizarre. To say that equalising the px size makes Nefertiti ``appear huge by comparison`` to Tiye seems to me to be wild exaggeration. It's a bit longer, but her actual head - which is the important thing - actually becomes smaller. I can't imagine any unbiassed person thinking there had been any attempt to give one prominence over the other. No two images are ever likely to be identical in all respects. The picture of Nefertiti is just the one that's currently used elsewhwere, not carefully chosen to trump Tiye by having some extra length! Differentiating the width disrupts symmetry across the page.  `

This is not a site to transmit Turkish denmilait propoganda any more then the Holocaust entry legitimizes Nazi false claims against the Jews. The level that the Turkish side approaches this issue is - for the most part - entirely unworthy of serious discussion - as it certainly is not presented as such. The issue here is first and foremost presentation og the Armenian Genocide - an event that did occur and is acknowlwedged as such by practically every serious scholar who is familiar with is - including an overwhelming number of Holocaust scholars. I agree that the current article is seriously lacking in context and detail - however a presentation that attempts to disprove the Genocide by offering up Turkish justifications and denials is a diservice to the truth and has no place here.  `

Now the reason for my impatience was precisely the Rudram ``precedent`` where you kept arguing for ages until it transpired that you were not familiar with the original text, but basing your opinion on a rather dubitable translation. Monier-Williams, at least, was working with the original texts. When he talks about shipivishta , he knows he is talking about shipivishta, and his comments are those of an impartial philologist, not those of either a Hindu or a Christian. Who says anything indeed? Encyclopedicity is determined by notability and verifiability. In matters of Sanskrit, there is simply no way around Monier-Williams and, for etymological questions, Mayrhofer. Note that I didn't touch any exegetical portions of the article.   re god vs. God, we need a historical approach. We need a section on Vedic Vishnu, and one on Puranic Vishnu. In the Rigveda, he was a deva, a solar god, I believe an aditya. In the Purana's, he is God. Same name, different concept: there is no problem.   `

The Unabomber phenomenon and mystique is almost totally wrapped up in Kaczynski; the Deep Throat phenomenon was an event in its own right. Keep then separate.
0	`=== Removed Personal Nerd Fluff ===Kibo is the nickname, username and e-mail address (kibo@world.std.com or kibo@kibo.com) of James Parry (b. July 13 1967), a Usenetter known for his sense of humor, various surrealist net pranks, an absurdly long .signature, and an uncanny, machine-assisted knack for joining any thread in which his nom de guerre is mentioned (to ``kiboze``). His exploits have gleaned him a multitude of enthusiasts, who celebrate him as the head deity of the joke pseudo-religion kibology, centered on the newsgroup alt.religion.kibology. James Parry grew up and lived in Schenectady, New York before moving to Boston, Massachusetts about 1990, where he lives today. He initially was a Computer Engineering major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, NY, but when he moved to Boston attended Emerson College, where he studied videography and graphic design.  At that time, he also worked as a typeface designer and for the world.std.com internet service provider, whose praises he sings on his website (in a rare moment where he is not being outrageously tongue-in-cheek).  He has a great artistic eye for typeface and developed several fonts in use today.Many assume his nickname is derived from the acronym KIBO, although Parry himself has repeatedly denied this.  Another rumor has it being short for King Body, a pseudonym he very briefly used on computer forums as a freshman at RPI in the mid-1980's.Kibo is a supertaster, and has prosopagnosia.  He frequently dyes his hair, which as of late 2004 is bright orange.  Kibo likes bacon, but greatly dislikes cheese.== External link ==*Kibo's website`

0	Mainly to JTD (i think) - I've just scanned through this discussion stuff having read the article. My initial impression was that this was going very kindly on the British indeed. It is admitted at some point in the discussion that there is a move among Irish historians away from previous over-simplifications of the matter - but isn't this move itself perhpas reactionary? I mean, Irish historians of this or any generation speak for their times, and, for lay readers like myself, the CONTEXT of this estimation of the role of the British imperial adventure in the famine is lost to those who have not studied so carefully the history of the history of the famine. This is, afterall, a general encyclopedia. So please twist the screws a bit. I won't go editing the article, but some feedback would be appreciated in this regard,Basically, you're all better historians than myself, but maybe some of your nuances are therefore misplaced here,(a bit less d'Alembert and more Diderot as it were)Cheers,Simon

I would never have created the Sonicblue page in the first palce, as imho, the company is not notable, unlike S3, which redefined the PC graphics industry in the mid 1990s.

Assume good faith (even when you are pretty sure that the other person is not acting that way). Never revert first. Don 't make or respond to personal attacks. If the other person is trying to make things heated try mediation. Following this lot can result in two outcomes: a. It ends up in arb comm and your case is unasible. b.your opponent adopts these tactics and you end up collaborating on the article.]If that only solved the loophole problems that exist by manipulating prejudice and other things on here which go unnoticed by all except those accused of vandalism or trolling.  I wish that we didn't have to deal with veiled supremacists, but they always try to achieve your trust.  I really don't look for edit wars and bitch sessions, but when others don't care and/or are oblivious to systemic bias it really pisses me off.  I'm about protesting injustice, with fighting words if that's what it takes to get attention on an issue.
0	`Hogging articles is not against the rules per se(or is it?), as is not(or is it?) also reverting any single thing for power over that info.  You have found a loophole and you've gone to exploit that weak jugular.  I will never concede to your pressure.  Anybody who is not Jewish and knows about Puritans I will converse with on this article, because I want it to be fair and balanced.  Apparently, the fact that this includes the topic of ``Jew`` offends every Jewish person here unless a Gentile or Goy gets your express permission prior to editing.  There is nothing else to this conversation.  Stalking is against the rules.   `

The condition number is known to be::where D is the diagonal matrix with entries equal to  and V_q is the generalized Vandermonde matrix (each column is a basis vector - e.g.  if q is the power basis - evaluated at each root).  You can consult for example Gautschi, Questions of numerical condition related to polynomials, or calcultate it by evaluating the Jacobian of f (which equals the matricial product in the formula above).  Remark that D is a n times n matrix while the Vdmonde is a n times n+1.If q is the power basis (say q=r),  becomes the traditionnal Vandermonde matrix.  If q is the Lagrange basis (say q=q), the generalized Vdmonde is the identity (and last column equals 0).  We have::since D is diagonal (at least for the infinity norm).  Since we can choose arbitrary a point y distinct from each root of p as additionnal interpolation point, it is always possible to choose it such that:: For example, if we consider the infinity norm, the point y=0 is always a such point unless it is already a root of p.  In this case, one can take a point y'' near zero.  All in all::

0	`== US emissions description is totally contentless now. ==The US section is total nihil. It is nothing more than a circular self-referencing system of cryptic abbreviations, without absolutely any kind of numerical data to back it up! I guess you do not understand? Well, based on the wikipedia info a US ``partial zero emissions vehicle`` could either be a bicycle (where the only emission is the cyclist's fart, to be rude) or a modified Hummer H1 SUV having an 1000 bhp Kenworth truck engine. There is no numerical info on the page to let us decide which is the case.Any person could create a system of circularly self-referencing acronyms and abbreviations for emissions categories out of thin air. Yet, it would still be zero information content. So either delete the US emissions section or add the numerical data (how many grams of CO2, NOx, SOx, unburnt fuel, particle charcoal matter are emitted per distance travelled) to back up those cryptic PZEV and alike codes with verifieable information.Look at the Euro-X standard descriptions. Each one is just a single sentence and it tells us the truth frankly. Weight and numbers, nothing else matters. Acronyms are PR bullshit and do not belong to an ecyclopaedia.It is a shame US people do not dare to face the polluting nature of their monster cars and try to hide the sad ``20mpg`` reality behind cryptic PZEV and similar abbreviations. In Europe 65mpg is reality now.Regards:Tamas Feher from HungaryE-mail: ``etomcat@freemail.hu```

0	Tristan, you seem to have survived the vote, appropriately. First of all it seems like you got VfD'd by a neophyte with (then) 15 edits under his belt, so it's not worth taking personally. There was some good criticism you got in the process such as the redirect problem. I'd say that it's clear to me that my User page and any potential Wikipedia article on me (when I get famous, you know, heh, or back on the B-list myself) serve entirely different purposes. The User page is strictly vanity and you can put in whatever you like  and I'd encourage it. The entry, on the other hand, is there for the public and should conform to policy and standards like notability.:Right now the article remains chatty and unencyclopedic. That sort of thing was probably acceptable once but now Wikipedians tend to strive for higher standards. I'll take a stab at improving it myself (I have other things I'd rather be doing! at least other Wikipedia articles) and I'd appreciate if you take my revisions as improvements to the usefulness of the article. Consider that a better article, and certainly one without the redirect, might not have been VfD'd in the first place.  |

On the other hand, how do you select who to include in the short list on the Bassist page? Some names, like Jaco Pastorius and James Jamerson are probably beyond dispute but it quickly gets fuzzy! I'd rather see the style of formatting for the list of bass guitarists used here (including a lot more people but perhaps with the stipulation that each should have a short descriptive text) and keep the other page for a names-only list that functions more as an index rather than giving any explanatory text. I also think that both lists would be improved by weeding out anybody who doesn't have at least a stub article of their own.

It is certainly not to write a better and more comprehensive micronational article!I have better things to do with my life, and I'll just write my own articles in my User file, where they don't bother nobody seeking publicity from the Wikipedia, and who finds the truth compromising to his success. I'll write my own articles if I feel like it.  can't make and will never make any real history with Atlantium, so he's chosen to do the next best thing: make his nation seem relevant in the Wikipedia, when in reality it isn't even relevant within the micronational community. == Baseball at the 2004 Summer Olympics ==Hi Rick,I wrote this quickly today following roughly how somebody had started the Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics.

I don't even have to look at the signature on a post to know who wrote it (that's on the talk page; the article is much, much more neutral—as one peer reviewer put it, probably as neutral as it can get).

0	** That about sums up what started this discussion in the first place.  On entries for railroad presidents I was adding the railroad name and years of the subject's presidency.  Now for some entries, such as for Ralph Budd (president of GN and CB&Q;) or for John W. Barriger III (president of Monon, P&LE; and MKT) or more recently for Mike Haverty (president of ATSF and KCS), this description could get quite lengthy as the managers moved around to different railroads.  For links to bios that have not yet been written, this information could be helpful for a potential editor to find information on the subject in order to write the bio.  However, after reading the comments above, I'm more inclined to agree on a minimalist description to keep the list uncluttered.  Separate list pages (such as one I'd been thinking about creating, List of railroad presidents) can go into more detail listing the information that we would otherwise have put into this list.  Personally, it doesn't matter much to me, but since a convention has been described, it's easy enough to follow.

Eisenhower due to his past close association with General Omar Bradley may have been apprised of the existence of the Venona project, the secret program within the U.S. Army Signals Intelligence Service decrypting KGB messages originating in the United States.  Eisenhower's former chief of intelligence and the first head of the CIA, General Walter Beedle Smith may have been brought in on the secret too, and the CIA began recieving some decrypted information in 1953.  There is no indication Eisenhower's Attorney General Herbert Brownell, Jr. was made aware of the highly secret information. This may explain why Eisenhower was willing to leave McCarthy barking up the wrong trees.`

0	`== Objectivity ==I realize this is a very controversial topic, but this article is simply not objective enough, and simply demonstrates American public opinion. For example, it is commonly accepted OUTSIDE of the United States that the fourth aircraft was downed by the US military. It is possible that the US media has exercised self-censorship and so the American public doees not have access to this information, but deleting caveats such as ``the 9/11 commission determined that...``, or putting it under ``conspiracy theories`` simply destroys objectivity.Could we not have this article explaining that it reflects the 9/11 commission's determinations, and have a prominent link to ``Disputes with the official account``? This would, hopefully, avoid offending people's sensitivity to the subject by keeping controversies off the main page, but also thereby reflecting a wider opinion?`

0	`== Leaning a little left of neutral ==After reading just the second paragraph (regarding the UN), I have to say the facts are clearly one sided.  Isn't it true that the ``Oil for Food`` scandal would/has clearly influenced the members on the Security Council?  That the Members on the Security Council had very large economic interests in Iraq and would loose them if there was a war, and now the clearly vocal SG of the UN now being implicated in influence in the ``Oil for Food`` scandal.  These facts would clearly give the reader a better understanding of a possible reason why the UN acted the way it did.The last and final resolution did warn Iraq of possible military solutions, if it did not comply.  One could clearly argue whether this is relevant or not, but just declaring that the Security Council was against the war without the above mentioned is avoiding reality.-I stand corrected this whole passage leaves out many important facts.  It also includes many unsubstantiated facts, such as Iraqi civilian deaths, that just go beyond the pale.This passage clearly needs a complete top to bottom rewrite.:i agree that the part you cite isn't neutral, but i strongly disagree with the characterization of its leaning as ``left``. anyway, it looks like you're new here at wikipedia. that's no reason you can't jump in and be bold. go to it, and good luck. (you'll need it. heh heh.)  14:10, 2005 Jun 18 (UTC)*I agree with you completelly. I'm glad you mentioned this on the talk page ahead of time as somebody who does lean a little left of center would certainly change your edits. This article needs to be rewritten. :Well, pick out a chunk that is the worst example of the POV you're objecting to, and either fix it, or, if you want to increase the odds that it will survive for a while, hammer out a suggested alternative here on the talk page.   ==Absence of declaration of war: police action==This article is titled 2003 invasion of Iraq, which is perfectly fine and NPOV, but to claim in the opening paragraph that it is a war is to miss the essential fact that there was and has been no such declaration of war. If it is a war then it is illegal, however if it is considered as a police action falling within the executive authority, then it may be given some legitimacy under emergency powers. Even so, insofar as we would commonly refer to the invasion as a war (like the Korean War, the Vietnam War, etc.) this was a preventive war, not a pre-emptive war, and this should also be stated.  :some quick points: the police action article is weak, and basically serves as a setup for somebody to call any undeclared war a ``police action``. that's euphemistic government-speak. whether a war is declared has no bearing on whether its a war. that's simple logic. if the distinction is important to you at the article outset, then simply call it what you appear to be claiming: an ``undeclared war``. however, then the problem is that it was declared, but by the president and informally, not by congress in any fashion. while ``undeclared war`` is a stretch, it's not nearly as much as ``police action``. further, the iraq war does not meet a rough criterion (``local``) of the wiki-linked police action article. a war against an entire country is not ``local``. ``police action`` is a government term, invented by presidential administrations and sycophants to pretend they hadn't violated the US constitution.:calling this a ``preventive`` war is about as POV as it gets. if you think ``preemptive`` is POV, then please remove that, rather than calling it something even more POV. and i'd caution against using phrases like ``more precisely`` as in the edits i reverted. that phrase, in both cases, was incorrect.  ::Since the president doesn't have constitutional authority to declare war, he cannot have declared it unless illegally. So you are saying it would be more NPOV to call this an ``illegal war`` than to call it a police action? I agree that undeclared war doesn't make sense. However, in common usage, it is a war, and most people won't immediately understand unless we say it is ``more precisely`` a police action. That is not POV, that is just clarification.:::straw man alert! and most people won't immediately understand what? no idea where you get the need to bring in this term ``police action``. it's nothing but a term that claims ``wasn't no war, holmes,`` while bodies are lying everywhere.

0	:Sure.  As a term, the list may be more common now than the radio format.  I was just tired of putting top 40 in articles and having it come up red.  I do think the radio format was first though.  Having 40 songs in rotation is just about the right number.  I remember some Top 30 stations and they just didn't make it.  Too repetitive even for pop radio.   On the other hand, I noticed the same thing about the links that you did, and stopped making them.  I can't quite imagine the content of the US Top 40 and UK Top 40 articles.  I suppose they could be lists of annual top 40 lists.   The radio format is important for noting all the wack songs that have made it.  The Mormon Tabernacle Choir is not what you usually think of as a Top 40 group, but because of the radio rules, there it was, mixing it up with the pop bands.

0	`== Walayah = State ==I'm not an expert in Arabic by any means, but my Arabic profssor said, unequivocally, that the use of the word ``Walayah`` could, in no way, be confused with the term ``nation,`` especially in the formal Arabic that OBL uses in his messages. In addition, the Hans Wehr Arabic dictionary defines the term as ``administrative district headed by a vali, vilayet (formerly, uner the Ottoman Empire(; province (=division of a country, e.g., Tunisia, Algeria); sovereign state (in a federal union)`` Also, it should be noted that the full name of the United States of America uses the plural form of ``Walayah.`` As far as I can tell, it is agreed upon that OBL was referring to states as individuals and NOT as nations in that particular speech and I feel that this should be noted.`

There's now a fully operational English demo site at demo.wikinews.org. This will be used for experimenting with various review models and basic policies before the site is launched officially in about a week. demo.wikinews.org will become the English version later. You voted for the Wikinews project, so I'm asking for your participation now. Everything is open, nothing is final. What Wikinews will and can be depends in large part on you. There already is a global Wikinews mailing list for discussing the project. If you are interested at all, please subscribe  coordination is of key importance. There's also an IRC channel #wikinews on irc.freenode.net. Realtime discussion can help to polish up articles. If you're looking for something to do, check out the articles in development and articles in review. Or start a new story in the Wikinews workspace, or ignore the proposed review system - it's up to you. I hope you'll join us soon in this exciting experiment.

They are both landlocked, but Swaziland borders Mozambique as well. Homelands were where the Apartheid government sent Blacks when they didn't have work permits - so I don't think another country counts. So - No.  :Thanks man ;-)  Does anyone know exactly how Lesotho got it's border?:Yes, In 1818, Moshoeshoe I consolidated various Basotho groupings and became their King. During Moshoeshoe's reign (1823-1870), a series of wars with South Africa (1856-68) resulted in the loss of extensive Basotho land, now known as the ``Lost Territory.`` In order to protect his people, Moshoeshoe appealed to Queen Victoria for assistance, and in 1868 the land that is present-day Lesotho was placed under British protection.  `

0	`It would be nice to know what are/were each nation's right-wing political parties, and whom from said parties became a leader of state.  18:08 Apr 14, 2003 (UTC)== Impartiality, please ==This article, as it stands, has a rather blatant left-wing bias.For example, fascism is closely linked to right-wing thinking byonly the third sentence! Since fascism is a 'radical' ideologyit would be anathema to anyone who regarded themselves as a 'conservative'. (Furthermore, fascism advocates large, intrusivegovernment, and therefore could be considered more akin to left-, rather than, right-wing philosophy, which advocates theexact opposite.)Also: ``in theory anyone has an equal chance in a free market. However in practice, a free market is likely [...] to result in [...] almost all of the real ``power`` held by a small percentage of the population. Hence, it can also be considered a doctrine of the right-wing.`` Hence? *Hence*? This seems to imply as /fact/ that a doctrine of the right-wing is that power should be held by a small percentage of the populationwhich is at best, a highly disputable opinion, at worst, a complete nonsense.:I agree with this criticism.  Economic ideology is better expressed somewhere else.  I've tried to rewrite it with a NPOV.  Let me know your thoughts. The article now seems to imply that ``right-wing`` is the same as ``conservative``, in the sense of resisting political change.  However I have the impression that right-wing is defined simply by opposition to left-wing doctrines, not opposition to change in general.  The leftist agenda is for government-mandated equality, in the mild version proposing equal rights for everybody under the law, followed by income redistribution through taxation, and in the extreme version progressing to communism.  E.g., if the left propose abolishing a monarchy, then anybody who opposes this is on the right, and is also conservative.  However if someone was to propose establishing a monarchy in a place where none ever existed, this would still be right-wing, but not conservative.  Does this make any sense?   :The concepts of political ``left`` and ``right`` will always be difficult to define precisely, because they are inherently amorphous, but I would say it is unfair to categorize right-wing thinking as merely being in opposition to change from left-wingers. :Speaking from a right-wing perspective, I would say that right-wing ideology is fundamentally *pragmatic* in naturei.e. right-wingers believe that change should take place in terms of *reform* of existing institutions which evolved over aeons and have successfully stood the test of time. Right-wingers are therefore naturally scornful of Marxist/Revolutionary ``idealists`` who believe in a ``Year Zero``, the discarding of all ``old`` ideas, and starting again from scratch (exemplified by such catastrophic failures Stalin's Five Year Plans, and Mao's Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution). In the case of the Cultural Revolution, 3000 years of Chinese culture was chucked down the pan, by ``enlightened`` left-wing philosophersalthough this is an extreme example, most left-wingers aspire to re-invent society in some such manner, and this will always be opposed not only by those who revere the past, but by those who have any grasp of pragmatism.:Although Libertarianism refuses to categorize itself as either left- or right-wing, I would say that many modern right-wingers are libertarian in nature, in that they believe in the freedom of the individual from the interference of the state, as opposed to the state-centric paternalistic view of the Left. Low taxation is a fundamental principle of the Right, and low taxation necessarily results in a smaller role for government, and (it is argued) therefore greater individual freedom.Hmmm its difficult this right-left wing thing, It seems to be something you instinctively ``know`` whether something is left or right wing, but when you come to define it in detail it becomes very difficult.There seems as far as I can tell, to be two different strands of right-wing politics which often contradict each other. There is a ``conservative`` right which generally opposes change from tradition, generally defends priveliged elites and wealthy interest groups, and opposes egalitarianism and is generally suspicious of rampant capitalism, often prefering protectionism, and favouring small business.And there is the ``free market`` or ``radical`` right, who are perhaps best exemplified by say Margaret Thatcher or Ronald Reagan who often profess to believe in traditional values etc, but advocate radical free market policies of deregulation, privatisatio

Like the Bob Costas quote in the article, one of the most remarkable things about Musial is that there isn't anything sensational. Since this is the discussion section I can state my personal opinion here. Musial has stayed in St. Louis, the city that made him famous, and he's always been generous in giving his time to charitable causes, even as his age has advanced and his health has declined. Virtually everyone who asks him for an autograph gets one. Why do you have interest in trashing the reputation of an old man who's done nothing but give back to his community for the past 40 years since his career ended?

0	`Q.  How are the barrels rotated?A.  The rotational force is delivered by two hydraulic drive motors operating off of both main aircraft hydraulic systems (A+B).  The motors deliver their torque to gearbox in the Hydraulic drive assembly.  This in turn delivers the force to two drive shafts.  The forward one goes to the rotor assembly on the GAU-8 itself, while the second delivers it's power to the ammunition drum.Q.  How long is typical spin-up time?A.  While the system is capable of operating at 4200 rounds per minute, it is limited to 3900 while installed in the aircraft.  Since the GAU-8 has 7 barrels it needs to spin at 1/7th of the firing rate.  Basically since it's rotating a touch over 550 rpm the spin-up time is almost instantaneous. On another point the statement on the gun gas on affecting the engines is complete rubbish.  During the firing of the GAU-8 the engines ingest so much gun gas that the engine igniters (think super spark plugs) must fire to ensure a stall does not occur.  The engines also will ingest so much soot from the firings that they need to be ``water washed`` (have water and a mild cleaning solution misted into the engines while running at approx. 80% power) periodically to remove soot from the blades.  Anyone who has had to clean an A-10 will tell you the gun gas goes just about everywhere aft of the nose.`

The abstract description says about the same amount about records in a much more widely applicable way in about two sentences. Maybe it could be made more newbie-friendly, but there's no need to do more than mention that C has support for records and that they're called structs. This is why I made the rather drastic change I did. I suspect this was the result of a merge of some sort.  `

0	`== Three revert rule==FYI, the three revert rule starts with ``This guideline applies to each person``. See Wikipedia:Three revert rule.  :FYI, it further states ``A growing consensus is that, since the mere incidental fact of one side outnumbering the other does not, alone, make the majority right, each side of an argument should be limited to 3 reverts per day``  ::Hang on. Where did you get that from. It doesn't say that at all. Instead, it says the exact opposite: ``3RR specifically does not apply to groups``  :::If it does not say that now then someone has been changing the policy to suit their POV, it was there last week.  ::::So when will an admin block cheese so that we can go back to editing an encyclopedia?   Arb Com election]] :::::So when will an admin ban Sam Spade so we can go back to editing an NPOV encyclopedia?  ::I can't seem to find a version of the article that says that. Please point it out to me as I would find it interesting to know who included it.   == Please don't delete or edit other people's comments ==CheeseDreams, please don't delete or edit other people's comments on the Talk pages. You've done it to me personally twice now (that I've noticed), once in the talk page of the Cultural and Historical Jesus, and (at least) once before on the Wikiproject:Jesus discussion page, when you made most of the discussion of Christology in the strikethrough font. You seem to be relatively new to Wikipedia, so I'm asking nicely. Say what you need to say, but let others say what they say and let their words stand on their own. Thank you.  :If you mean a comment in the summary, that is because I summarised the text. Your comments can be viewed at archives 2-5.:And on Wikiproject:Jesus, I struckthrough (but did not delete) items which had been actioned. This is the standard practice for todo lists is it not? :: I meant the comment on the summary itself, encouraging people to read those archives instead of relying on someone's summary. On Wikiproject:Jesus, the text you marked as strikethrough were not part of a todo list, it was a discussion of whether to do anything with Christology at all. In both cases it appears that you were trying to delete or conceal my objections to your proposals, rather than actually respond to them. Maybe that wasn't your intention, but it certainly had that appearance.  \:::It already says that the full text is in the archive, and that the summary is by me, and disputed by you.:::W.r.t. the wikiproject, if you note the talk page, you will see that I struck through everywhere that there was discussion which I had actioned. If I had intended to delete or conceal your objections, I would merely have deleted the text, or put    tags round it.  :: Also regarding your summary of Slrubenstein's comments, ``yanking someone's chain`` doesn't have anything to do with masturbation in the U.S., at least when used in the context Slrubenstein used it. It just means he wondered if FT2 were saying things just to get a reaction from him. That's probably an honest misunderstanding between the two of you, but it might be helpful if you acknowledged it and corrected that part of your summary. Thanks.   :::If Slrubenstein agrees to retract his uncivility toward FT2 such as ``charicature of a nut``, ``ar eyanking my chain``, ``your reasoning is specious and ignorant``, and apologise for them, then I am perfectly willing to remove the comments from the summary. Until that time, they remain, since this is how I and other non-US (remember that the majority of english speakers are not in the US) readers read the text.:::I have also just looked the phrase up in a slang dictionary, and cannot find an alternative meaning to the phrase.  :::: I agree, most English speakers are outside the US, so it's a very understandable misunderstanding. Here are links to a couple of definitions that I think are better than the one I gave, and probably closer to what SLR meant: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=yank+one's+chain and http://www.ozyvoyuer.com/aussieslangdictionary.html#Y. (The second looks Australian, so it's not a strictly US-centric usage.)   ==Arbitration==Thanks for pointing me in the direction of the RfA. A lot of familiar names in that crew! I don't know that I'd call them a cabal but I know what you mean. They've learned that the best way to push a POV is to gather a small gang. The way Wikipedia is structured it's easy to subvert consensus by doing so. I'll try to have a look at what's passed and if I can comment constructively, I'll do that.  Regarding arbitration, CheeseDreams, I was not implying at all that I didn't agree that I should recuse myself  I did so, as I hope you noticed.  I was noting that it is Arbitration Committee practice for someone involved peripherally in a dispute (or directly, of course) to recuse themselves, and that in the past no one has needed to prompt arbitrators to do this.  We're intelligent, we're committed to fairness, and we police ourselves pretty effectively in this regard.  I was just wishing you'd have given me the courtesy of waiting to see if I would recuse myself from the case, rather than assuming I wouldn't.  I will note, though, that the standard you suggest is generally considered too high for arbitration here.  In a case like yours, it's obvious that with so many involved parties (in a relatively small community), all of those people will know at least one arbitrator  mere acquaintance does not require an arbitrator to recuse.  We recuse when we're involved in the case itself, or when one of the involved parties is either a long time enemy or close friend.  If arbitrators could only hear cases involving users they had never before encountered, we couldn't arbitrate any case effectively.  Just thought I'd offer my thoughts, and let you take them as you please.On another note, I am not sure if it was you who wrote the phrase ``cabal of 'fundamentalists'`` in your arbitration request, but if you did, I'd suggest to you that it might be wise not to use that phrase.  The list of users who oppose you includes at least one very dedicated atheist and at least one other person who is openly hostile to Christianity  characterizing the list as ``fundamentalist`` will be seen as a blanket generalization.  Obviously you can do as you please, but I think other users will notice the word and the users, as I did, and be confused or else draw negative assumptions (i.e., characterizing atheists as ``fundamentalists`` might be seen as an indication that one is hasty to judgment, etc.).Now, I'm sure you don't much like getting a note from me, so I'll disappear, but if you ever do feel like talking, I want you to know that I'd be happy to.  As I hope you can see above, I'm not ``out to get you``.  I'd like to understand you a little better, and I'd like to be able to work with you productively if I can.  If you'd like to talk about it, drop me a .  Thanks,  :Unlike most of the arbitration committee, as far as I am aware, you have actually engaged in debate over controversial issues with me. I regard that as being ``an involved party``.  :No, I wrote the phrase 'cabal of ``fundamentalists``', please note the quotes around the word ``fundamentalist``:I have absolutely no issue with getting a note from you.  ::I'm glad  here's another note then.  You seem to misunderstand me (perhaps I'm not communicating well).  I have agreed with you on two separate pages already that I most certainly am an involved party.  I don't want to sound at all rude, but I have to admit that your continued responses to me are making me wonder if you understand what I mean when I say that I have ``recused`` myself from the case.  If I am wrong, please forgive my suggestion.  But if you are unclear on what it means, it means that I have openly declared that I am an involved party and that I will not offer any arbitrator opinions (or any votes) on your case, should it be accepted.  I apologize if it is unclear  I had thought that ``recuse`` was common in the English court system as well, but I confess I do not know it well, and perhaps that is the source of the confusion.  As far as the quotation marks around ``fundamentalist``...well, as I said, it's your choice.  I can't claim that I understand what difference in meaning is implied by the quotes, but I don't suppose it's important for me to understand.  Thanks for replying nicely  I apprecia

What about some major contributions, such as that he was one of the first to talk about hygiene, the value of fresh air, sunshine, etc., that he fought for the purity of medicines in an age of adulteration, leading homeopaths everywhere to fight for better medical standards, such that in the US and Canada, for example, the homeopaths formed the first medical associations, which the AMA was formed to combat, or that he was a famous chemist and medical translator, his texts used throughout Germany, that he treated royalty, a tradition that continues with the British and Dutch royal families to this day? He was also a strong opponent of ``heroic measures`` drawing medicines attention back to the Hippocratic nil nocere.Does anyone else feel this article really does Dr. Hahnemann a disservice?  `

I'd like to discuss that with author of changes, or i will change that to sounding more neutral, since this is strictly lithuanian, nationalistic, unrealistic, biased point of view.szopenI would like to point, that ,,Polonisation of Lithuania was not effect of state policy, nor it was goal of Union of Lublin, that Jogaila wanted union with Poland as much as Polish lords, that ,,Western Lithuania taken by Poland in 1920 had majority of Poles who in in referendum voted to joining Poland (referendum was boycotted by Lithuanians, but even if it wasn't, that won't change results, and anyway, this article is _BIASED_szopen from PolandBefore we go further, I would like to point out that the Annales Quedlinburgensis or Annals of Quedlinburg, are not imperial, nor even royal.

[1) that do not affect local government; 2) as for representation in national parlament - polish districts ussually shows smallest participation in elections  (which is not what you would expect from discriminated people)]::according to what i read in Polish press, Lithuanian gvt changed borders of districts so region with Polish majority was divided and added to regions with Lithuanian majorities, so in effectc Poles lost representation in local government szopen* transcription of names and family names that are written in Lithuanian [please name the country there this is not a case]:in regions where 100% population is Polish they still have to call themselves with those funny endings in administrative offices; and the greatest Polish poet is not Mickiewicz but Mickiewiczius ??? [do you propose to use one name in local administration and another in national? What to do when papers go from one level to another? do you claim that lithuanian in Poland could achieve his last name MickeviÄ*ius written according to lithuanian rules? you still did not name the country there are no adaptation of foreighn names to local language]:: But in Poland, if your name is Mauricius, you will have that name in documents, not Mauricjuski, Mauricz or whatever.

Since these are facts, the arguing about alledged POV is really not according to Wiki rules, that state that balance and NPOV is not to blur facts.

0	I'm not editing the article regarding the numbering of the Fort Smith section of I-540 because it seems the writer may have been there more recently.  However, IIRC when I traveled that road shortly after the newer part of I-540 was completed a few years back, the exit signs and mileposts WERE renumbered to be consistent with the new road (i.e., from Oklahoma line north), though local billboards still had the old exit numbers.  Perhaps an AHTD re-signing project erroneously restored the original exit numbers and mileposts?

0	`==Removal of POV links==While it is true that minorities may have faced discrimination in some parts of Bangladesh, adding a host of links about ``Ethnic cleansing`` in Bangladesh is POV. The article is about ``Hinduism in Bangladesh``, so adding these links, most of which seem to be taken from Right wing websites or News articles, do not serve any purpose. These are not credible, and are unsubstantiated. I am interested in expanding the article, by adding sections on the History part and the different dynasties, and the religious sites, and the status of hindus in BD. However, adding links just for anti-Bangladesh/Islam rant would not help the article be NPOV. Thanks.  `

0	`===Wikipedia:WikiProject_Drugs===I need to start a project that automates factual changes/insertions (like rambot).  A lot of incorrect information exists in or basic factual information is missing from drug related articles.  This is stuff that can be easily looked up online and are basic scientific facts for which there is no argument over.  The information can be found from several online drug databases including rxlist.com, medlineplus.gov, the official websites of drug manufacturers (they have free, detailed information sheets) and other various websites.I plan on writing a bot which can automatically 'rip' factual information (which is non-copyrightable due to its factual nature) and create an off-site database.  I will offer this database for free for people to download, so both they and I can work on bots that can integrate the information in articles.This would require considerable collaboration with the drugs wikiproject people to provide a standard format for all drugs articles beyond the simplistic efforts taken so far so that I can ensure the bot will behave properly and insert information only in a correct manner.For clarity, this is information regarding side effects, [bio]chemistry, routes of administration, drug names (brand name and genericmy bot will autmoatically look up International Nonproprietary Name, USAN, BAN and other names) as well as other clearly factual things.A question needs to be raised regarding drug pages, how should they be organized?  The full information sheets on drugs are very large and rather complicated from a lay person's perspective, perhaps it would make sense to integrate full infomration (including the results of studies on it) on a separate ``full information`` page while keeping the main page a summary?===Wikipedia:WikiProject U.S. Supreme Court cases===Some of the SCOTUS articles (Lawrence v. Texas, Bowers v. Hardwick) have caught my interest and I may decide to do some bot automation with them also, but I'm not sure what yet.  There are various large legal database websites available which I can legally rip information from in the same manner as with the drug project above.See also: Category:U.S. Supreme Court cases`

0	`== Dubious claims about clearly non-transgenderd people ==This article lists a whole bunch of people whos transgender status is clearly wrong and others for whom it is highly speculative.  This isn't a list of people who ``kinda, sorta, there's a small chance, maybe`` are transgender.The ones who cross-dressed for some nefarious/deceptive purpose and not as a life style choice clearly can not be classified as transgender and should be removed from the article completely.  The fact that mythological figures such as Achilles were even added in the first place says a lot about the POV pushing of the people who supported it.  The only mythological one who might be considered transgenderes is Guan Yin.  The real life figures who did it to disguise themselves to avoid something (e.g. military service) or even to get into something where women are discriminated against.  They did it for deceptive purposes as well, so they can't really be considered transgendered.The pope one is laughable and definitely should be removed.  The one about Joan of Arc is based exclusively on an accustion from a unreliable source.  If they accused her of being a witch, should we have included her in a list of witches too?  Also, I'd like to see an authoritative source showing that she was even accused of it as it seems that it's most Wikipedia ripped sites and LGBT websites that site that as fact.And what are ``transvestite tendencies`` in reference to Ed Wood?  You need to start citing sources or I'm just going to start deleting them.  That goes mainly for the historical and mythological figurse section.Maxwell Klinger wasn't even a real transvestite, he only did that so he'd get a section 8 and get kicked out of the army.  Anyone who watched the show knows he would try all kinds of crazy stuff to get kicked out under the guise of being mentally ill.  This phrase describing the character is also very odd: ``Although a transvestite, he loudly denied any charges of homosexuality.``  What's the association between the two?Also, it appears they're using a warped definition of transgender here.  I've never heard a definition that would automatically include cross-dressers as if that automatically means they identify with the opposite gender rather than just enjoying the clothes.  I'm sorry, but this overly broad and incorrect definition of transgender is obviously an attempt just to make the list as long as possible. 28 June 2005 21:00 (UTC)`
0	` article title==When did the title start displaying as π ? -  That's even worse.  Now I see a completely odd, non-Latin, non-Greek character.   ==Shanks==Shanks' famous calculation of π is listed twice in the history corresponding to two different years, 1853 and 1874.  What's going on there?   *I think the 1853 date is wrong (according to other sources).   == BCE vs BC ==Don't switch existing BCE usage to BC (or vice versa) without very good reason.  This is the same as the issue of American vs. British spelling for words, and the precedent (leave usage as it is originally written) is the same.  There are good arguments on either side (BCE is the academic/scholarly standard, even in British textbooks... and BC is more widely known, particularly outside North America) but until there is a Wikipedia standard on this issue (and there currently isn't) leave BCE/BC usage alone.  18:38, 2004 Aug 29 (UTC):Well here are some very very good reasons for switching all BCE/CE to BC/AD, but first let me deal with your opinions. This is not the same issue as AE vs. BE. There is no controversy in usage of language versions, just personal preference usually based on country of origin, so the precedent 'leave as originally written' doesn't apply here. In fact, because there's no Wiki standard, not very much does apply, apart from NPOV. BCE is the academic/scholarly standard... Is it? I don't think so. It's certainly making inroads, particularly in internet writing originating from America, but it's virtually unknown in the rest of the world and is certainly not a standard in British text books.:So why change? :1)Quite simply because use of BCE/CE is 'POV'. The de-facto global standard is BC/AD. A minority in the USA are trying to push their politically correct alternative (and having some success) and to use it in Wikipedia is to support this minority standpoint. Maybe BCE/CE will eventually become the de-facto global standard. If it does, then Wikipedia should adopt it, but in the mean time it use here is, in effect, supporting a political objective. Wikipedia should not promote this usage.:2)Wikipedia should not use terminlogy that most of the world does not understand. An article on pi is relevant to everyone the world over. Readers should not have to ask the question '.. what's all this BCE stuff?'.  ::BCE is not American Political Correctness  it goes back several hundred years (the 15th century, I believe) and originated with Rabbinic scholars.  BCE/CE and BC/AD are both' POV, there's no escaping it.  Nonetheless, BCE/CE is the academic standard in the English-speaking world (try to find a history textbook  even a British one  published in the last decade that still uses BC/AD).  However  in Wikipedia articles we still accept Standard units of measurement (feet, miles, gallons'') despite the fact that the academic standard (even in the US) is to use Metric.  So like I wrote earlier, there are good arguments on either side.  Until there's a consensus (and the Pi article isn't the place to form it), it's best to leave the BCE/BC usage as the original author wrote it.  (And for the record, I personally use ISO date formats.)   04:28, 2004 Aug 31 (UTC)I admit that I'm not North American, but also, I didn't know what the heck this BCE/CE stuff was about. Then I found it on WP, via List of acronyms. Now, just some google hit counting: 881 for ``before christian era``. 9,100 for ``before common era``. (1st hit is a good reference: www.radix.net/~dglenn/defs/ce.html) 81,300 for ``common era`` -``before common era``. 92,200 for ``common era`` 269,000 for ``before christ`` 278,000 for ``anno domini``although maybe not needed, 3 further comments* the ``AD`` is probably underestimated, because so well known that explanation/spelling out is probably less frequent w.r.t. occurence* I also agree with ``leave as is`` if there's not a really undisputable reason for changing* ``(before) common era`` seems to me much more POV than ``before christ``.—   == Historical values ==The first two historical values for pi given are both in bold, and so were (presumably) both world records. However, the first one is actually closer to pi than the second. What's going on there?NEWLI
0	`===Wikipedia:LGBT notice board===This explains a lot of the experience I've had in LGBT articles, this is used as a recruitment point to spread LGBT based propaganda.  They are not the slightest bit interested in POV and get offended when you delete clearly POV and unsubstantiated, dubious content.  They suggest you basically write the article from scratch for them since it's crap, because to them it's better to keep in totally incorrect propaganda then have a small article.They insist on making a million different articles covering every topic, sub-topic and sub-sub-topic on everything related to LGBT stuff (notice the abundance of ``Homosexuality and`` type articles), there is TONS of redundant information.  They're basically among the most close-minded POV pushers on Wikipedia and given their persistence it's an annoying problem.  The herd is noticeable on VfD pages, 4 of the 7 votes to keep the pro-feminism article, for example, came through recruited from this wikipedia notice board.  7 votes were for deletion, because clearly the article made no sense to exist (it's all just reiterating feminist beliefs whilst repeating ``pro-feminist men believe...`` over and over).  Without this notice board, their POV and other silly articles wouldn't stand a chance on VfD.`

0	`Decius despite what those people claim, it's literally more likely to meet a Turk in Norway than a Skopjan in Greek Macedonia. How can there be any violence if there's practically no minority? The 20 people who comprise the Skopjan political party Rainbow (got something like 100 votes in the elections) are the only official record I'm aware of and that's because they have a website. Once they tried to put up some propaganda posters written in Cyrillic but had their office smashed on the next day, and ``thus was this matter settled``. Macedonian Slavs will claim that some 95% of Greek Macedonia is ethnic Skopjan, opressed by the Greek government and forbidden to speak its language etc, etc, etc. The story about the infamous ``partition`` of Macedonia refers to the defeat of Bulgaria during the Balkan Wars. Of course there's no record of a ``Macedonian`` army ever taking part, although in their history books it can reach up to 100,000 soldiers (that would be 1/6 of the army of Napoleon and slightly smaller that the army that conquered Constantinople under Mehmed II). I mean those people are bitching about a territory that they didn't manage to steal in the last century and expect to be taken seriously. Imagine what kind of bitching would equivalently Greeks be entitled to against the Turks, for their mass expulsion from regions that had been inhabited by Greeks since ancient times (such as coastal Asia Minor, Constantinople, Pontus, Cyprus etc, etc)...  29 June 2005 12:44 (UTC)`

0	`WTF are you talking about?  There is no admin decision against me to not edit gender articles.  I'm full allowed to edit any and all articles.  Not only are you engaging in slanderous accusations, you're telling flat out lies.  I'd say spreading flat out lies which have absolutely not basis in reality against other members is a violation of several Wikipedia policies, so you better be VERY careful about what you say.  I strongly suggest that you retract your slanderous accusation before you further discredit yourself.Why the heck would I make changes under an alternate account when I have the full capability of doing it under this account?  Also, where have I inserted any kind of right wing or religious views here?  Nothing I've said has anything to do with religion nor does it have anything to do with politics.  My points are extremely valid and you only rejected them because of your ridiculous personal biases and need to push your POV.  Not only are transvestites not necessarily transgendered, there are quite a few people on this list who are clearly NOT transvestites even using the description given in the article itself.  I have to question how anyone thought it was a good idea to add them.  I should also note that you're being hypocritical here, you're reverting a change on the basis that it hasn't been discussed, when you yourself refuse to discuss it!  I'd be very interested to know why a) non-transgendered people should be included on a list of transgendered ones and b) why transvestite is used as automatic criteria for seeing if someone is transgendered, even though there is nothing in the definition that indicates that.Frankly, this kind of behavior is appalling.  The supposedly open minded LGBT Wikipedian cliques criticize ``right wing religious`` people (and by right-wing religious that means anyone who doesn't agree with their extremist views) is actually one of the most close-minded groups on wikipedia, with the least likely chance of actually discussing things (as evidenced here) and least likely to consider others views.   29 June 2005 22:08 (UTC)`

The poll  respondants also presumably have no way of knowing why they were stopped by police.

Is the author of the paragraph arguing that ``genetic potential`` is the only valid way of describing ``intelligence`` now too? What is the scientific basis for such an argument?

The word Wikiclique is an accurate description of some Wikipedians behavior. That can't really be denied. :Rather, the word ``wikiclique`` is a schoolyard insult that can only serve to infuriate the very people with whom you are trying to reach consensus.  The issue you're raising on the Village Pump is important, but I feel that your vituperance is diminishing it and alienating others.  If you expect civility, you must be civil yourself.  . :Clearly == beta Systemic Bias section ==(Regarding gathering support for removing the systemic bias from the Wikipedia)Hi, if you wish to help contribute to a beta version of a Wikipedia page section designed to counter-act Wikipedia's systematic bias, please sign the bottom of this section on the Village pump - Wikipedia:Village_pump#Systemic_bias_in_Wikipedia. If not, no worries. :I can't sign yet; I need to know more.  All I gleaned from your conversation is that you feel an emphasis on things less important than the Congo Civil War and the Holocaust constituted a bias.  What other articles do you feel betray this bias?  What, to you, is the set of articles that, when expanded, will counteract aforesaid bias?Alternately, if you don't have a clear idea of what precisely is causing the bias, then why raise such a ruckus about fixing it?  None of us know or can predict what makes you feel that the Wikipedia is biased, and we all have different ideas about what articles need emphasis.  You'll need to help us out and flesh out your idea more.I think the present method (i.e., let people work as they will) is the best solution for the moment.  Eventually, every important topic will get covered, even if the fanboys get to write their novels and video games into the Wikipedia first.  . ::Your characterisation of my argument doesn't match with what I think.

So it was ironic that another variation has been thrown into the equation.I would like to arrive at a uniform format for all these lists - and I think that it is achievable - but may not be to everyone's taste.This is how I see it:-Head of State is the 'modern' generic label for a 'ruler' of an independent state.  There are some regions which are not independent states (those located in African countries, for instance) which it would be right to use the term 'rulers' for the leader.Head of Government is a generic for the primary official in the government of an independent or non-sovereign state.For clarity I like to try to avoid 'concurrency' on a single page - unless it is unavoidable, the page should comprise a single chronologically consecutive list and the phrase to present should only appear once on the page.Some lists are quite long already, and I am aware that to combine lists would put some people's backs up.But then again, to combine some and not others would be inconsistent and would vary how people approach each list.Anyway,  as I say this is only how I see it.  The concensus should prevail - and if hundreds of people disagree with me (rather than the odd one or two) then sobeit.I am always open to working in collaboration in the project. Hope my reasoning makes some modicum of sense.Thanks again for your message.  Speak soon.   :Although it doesn't sound as formal, perhaps ``List of leaders of X`` could serve the combined role of ``List of X-ish heads of state`` and ``List of X-ish heads of government.``  After all, the world leader is timeless, while the word state meant nothing before the advent of the modern nation-state.  (Just a proposal.  I'm not sure of precedent or what the current convention is leaning towards right now.)  . ::I'm just concerned that that might sound ambiguous - and someone is bound to jump up and down about a perceived ambiguity!  :::You have a good point.  I meant ``leader-as-in-an-executive-office-holder-or-similar-position,`` not ``leader-as-in-role-model.``  For me, ``Leader of Afghanistan`` pretty clearly refers to the person calling the shots, and not, say, other members of the interim government or to anyone in any leadership role over there.  But I acknowledge the ambiguity.I think we're stuck.  English doesn't have a single clear, unambiguous phrase for the person in charge — it depends on when and where they're in charge.  If I had to choose between ``heads of state`` and ``heads of government``, I would choose the latter over the former every time, even if that meant listing leaders who, in their days, were not heading what we would now call a government.  . ==Logos==(Regarding the copyright status and appropriate tag for Media:Wikimedia.png and related images)It's GFDL but it's also a trademark, so can't be used in the same way as most other GFDL images.

0	== Historical Works Of Isaac Asimov, a Historiographical Analysis ==I, Historian Stephen: “But you are telling me, Susan, that the ‘Society for Humanity’ is right; and that Mankind has lost its own say in its future.”Susan: “ It never had any, really. It was always at the mercy of economic and sociological forces it did not understand – at the whims of climate, and the fortunes of war. Now the Machines understand them; and no one can stop them as they are dealing with the Society, - having as they do, the greatest of weapons at their disposal, the absolute control of our economy.”Stephen: “How horrible!”[1]             The author of this dialogue is Isaac Asimov. Similar references to the history of humanity are widely used in his literature works. The author is a well-known writer of future societies, not only in fiction but also as treatises of the ‘march of humanity’ into the future. Neither in his stories, nor in the historical essays of Asimov can one easily find references to great changes in a society through the works of great men, great ideas or greatness of an arbitrary institution. This paper will investigate the historiographical method and mode of historical writing of Isaac Asimov.  The Writer:Seldom thought of as a scientist, less even as an essayist, and almost never as a historian. The famous author of some of the best-known science fiction literature... Hailed as a “Grand Master” in 1986 by the Science Fiction and Fantasy writers of America Inc., Isaac Asimov has produced over 470 books on a large variety of subjects[2]. Among his portrayals as a writer are, as listed by one of his publishers Houghton Mifflin Company, novelist, humorist, futurist, current world record holder in literary output etc. Yet, more importantly Asimov was a PhD holder in the field of chemistry, a professor in Boston University. More relevant still for the purpose of the present work is the historian persona that Asimov assumed numerous times.[3]              Asimov was born in January 2, 1920 in Petrovichi, Russia to a Jewish family that emigrated to the United States. He grew up in Brooklyn and graduated from Columbia University in 1939, obtaining his PhD in the same establishment in 1948. He joined the faculty of Boston University thereafter, and remained associated to B.U., however not in a teaching capacity from 1958 on. He died in 1992, his death was later revealed to have been as a result of contracted HIV from a bypass surgery he received in 1983[4].             Despite the fact that there are various different elements to his character, Asimov was a writer first and foremost. His first publications were in the genre of science fiction, first of which was published in an issue of Amazing Stories magazine in March 1939. Asimov claims that writing had been “ . . . merely an amusement,” and that he had hoped for a few dollars to help pay his college tuition.[5] Furthermore, for the introduction of his one hundredth work, he professes that he had never planned anything at all in his writing career, and that his commercial success was an “incredulous relief.” As for his historical works he claims that they were “primarily intended for non-historians,” as his science books were primarily intended for non-scientists.             He is not only an amateur that has deep interests in history, but also a science-fiction novelist, whose literature work is influenced by his knowledge of history. Asimov’s major works, the Foundation and Robot series to name a few, depict the future not through the wars and technological accomplishments of humanity but they portray the human societies of the future, with a dominant preconception of formation and function of the past societies. To name a specific case; he declares that the fictitious Galactic Empire that is in power in the Foundation Series were written with certain periods of the Roman history; “Justinian and Belisarus of the sixth century and a little bit Tiberius and Sejanus of the first century…” to be exact, in mind.[6]  The Works:Isaac Asimov is interested in history not only out of personal curiosity, but he can also justify this curiosity in terms of his profession. Asimov states; “… we surely cannot grasp the significance of population, energy, technology, and other subjects today without seeing them in the context of the past.” Therefore as a professional author of science fiction, and a speculator of future societies, Asimov believes that “… without knowing where we came from, we cannot easily detect where we are going.”[7]            His outlook of history is pre-deterministic and conceptualized materialistically; and for the most part simplistically. In dealing with the rise and fall of political unities, he ofte

0	`== islam the religion of peace???? ==My mind is not able to accept the fact that islam is a religion of tolerance,humanity,love etc. why? Let me elucidate it -islam is the only religion which is spread through force or by giving some benefits to man as they will force woman & children to convert to islam.The benfits include four time marriage,divorce can be done by saying ``divorce-divorce-divorce`` & you can ``buy`` another girl & force her to marry with you by giving some money to her father.muhammad himself married to a 9 year girl when he is 60 year old fat ball (Yes muhammad is a pedophile).Some of the ugliest punishments is reserved for islam like beating to death a woman or man by stoning(as this is happening is various muslim nations),beheading,lashes etc.Womans are treated like animals & there job is restricted only to give birth to as many childs as they can(untill she dies giving birth to yet another child).They are forced to wear ``burqas`` in public & to have a white plaster on face in home.These all things attract only those people from a society who thinks that this is the ``opportunity`` to satisfy there desires.They are ofthen those individuals who have lowest ethics in life.And why muslims are spread all over the world? ,The reason is that as all societies in the world have some real opportunitists,cowards in some number then only those choose this religion,this is unlike HINDUS & SIKHS who are mainly concentrated in south asia initially(Now they are going to other parts of the world).Now some of the muslims are even not fully confident about islam, they know that in todays world practicing this religion in it's full version is not possible so they have created there own version and labeled it as ``tolerent islam`` that means that even they also knows that islam is not tolerent in it's full version.How is it possible that you pick one thing from islam as per your convenience like only jehad is picked up by muslims all around the world.Today even muslim don't trust another muslim(not to talk about another religions) most notabley is the numerous fighting between muslim countries & muslim groups like iran-iraq,balochistan-pakistan etc.This is why they are not able to achieve muslim ummah or unity of muslims.Only muslims are fighting in all around the world(as they are intolerent towards another religions) name it chechanya,palestine etc.As long as they are in minority they live quietly only waiting for an opportunity to come.And also multiplying there numbers(thanks to 4 marrigies & 10 childs per marrige).Then they start the fight for a separate homeland.One more mystery waiting to be demystified - How long can islam survives in this century ?`

Let me elucidate it, when muslims came to INDIA only those cowards change there religion(From Hinduism & sikhism mainly) who are afraid of them as they will beat them, whereas hindus & sikhs(those who choose not to change there religion due to fear) confronted them with power.Due to this reason pakis are not able to even talk confidently as there is always a complex in there mind about this.pakis are the opportunists always seeking ways to bleed INDIA (there Motherland too),But they are failed to realise this that we are the same people ,if we can fight with the might of englishmen then we can rip apart the pakis.Freedom is given by INDIAN nationalists to INDIA, when they saw this happening then they(jinnah etc.) form a plan(As the are opportunists) to divide INDIA as this will satify there need to have a grater share in power.Then jinnah himself said when he is about to die that ``pakistan is the biggest blunder of my life``.Pakis are now killing poor balochs as balochs are resisting pakis attempt to exploit the land through various lollypops like gwadar port etc.But as a nation created by dividing the land they should now make up there mind as further 2 or 3 divisions of pak is inevitable.``Pakis`` your fate is written all over the wall - read it and accept it.`

0	::My mistake. I came off sounding like a huge Bush supporter there. I was just trying to correct the possible misleading statement of my fellow Wikipedian. I have no problem including any of Bush's approval ratings, but only when notable. I haven't looked at other presidents articles too much, but I suppose there should be some continuity between them. Also, to say Bush's low numbers right now are a direct result of the War in Iraq is also misleading. Many people, including many Republicans, are upset with his stance on the border, Social Security, etc. Life in 2005 is not all about Iraq. Feel free to quote me on that.  6 July 2005 15:07 (UTC)

0	`== Article contains too much incorrect information ==I'm going to rewrite large portions of this article some time soon because the authors who wrote them don't understand what ad hominem means.  If there are any objections to this, please voice them here.  There is a very common misconception going around, that ad hominem is simply an attack against the person you're arguing with, but that is not necessarily the case.  Likewise, an 'attack' doesn't have to be name-calling or anything like that.  It could simply be something like ``you are wrong because you don't have a PhD in the subject.``There is a very important distinction that some, but not all parts of the article make between to types of attacks.Ad hominem attack:  ``Your argument is wrong because of [something about the person they are arguing with].``*``That piece of evidence may be true, but how could you possibly be right, you don't have any kind of degree or certification in this area.``*``There's no way he could be right about this area of quantum physics, the guy dances around naked in his house!``Non-ad hominem attack: ``You're such a(n) [disparaging remark].  You are wrong because of [insert reasoning unrelated to the person].``*``These statistics from this highly credible polling agency clearly show that you're wrong about the prevelance of it.  Why am I even arguing with this idiot?  I should really learn to stop arguing with someone who couldn't even get a GED.``*``That's it, you're too stupid to argue with, bye.``*``Here's a comprehensive study showing why you're wrong.  In the future I suggest that you take some courses in this before arguing about it.``See the distinction?  If there's any confusion, I can clarify further.Please note that there is an exception of sorts, if the person you're arguing with IS the subject of the argument, then you can attack the characteristics of the person which are relevent to the argument.  Although I'm not sure if that's really an exception or just not considered ad hominem to begin with.  It depends if you define ad hominem as ``attacking the person as a basis for your argument`` OR ``attacking the persno as a basis for your argument in place of attacking their argument.``  The latter definition has the exception built-in, since you'd be attacking the person in addition to (not in place of) their argument. 6 July 2005 17:08 (UTC)`
0	`== Inverted Ad Hominen is non-notable ==When I correct the ad hominem article later, I'm zapping the 'inverted ad hominem' term.  It is completely non-notable (86 hits in google) and was invented and inserted into the article by .  Heck, the article itself even attributes it to Layman, a random web user, as having said it.*Original edit inserting it under an ip address*Edit by User:Layman the same dayThere's a reason why the term wasn't invented by logicians too, because ``inverted ad hominem`` is still ad hominem.  There's no ``inverse`` about it.  The so-called ``inverse ad hominem`` is just a case of ad hominem where someone says ``my qualifications are better than yours`` instead of directly saying ``your qualifications suck.``  The meaning is the same and there is no reason for another term.I really don't think there is any question that this and the silly thing about it being coined should be removed. 6 July 2005 17:19 (UTC)`

0	`'s rule (1924-1953) - 40-60 million (but at least 20) million dead.``Some editors find this number highly exagerated (the original text simply said ``20 million or more dead``).The proponents of the higher numbers cite this quote in their support:* ``According to Roy Medvedev, Stalin's victims numbered forty million. Solzhenitsyn says the number is far greater-perhaps sixty million. The debate continues even now.``From the book: Lenin's Tomb  The Last Days of the Soviet Empire by DAVID REMNICK (p. 129).My question is. Are the numbers cited above (40-60 million dead) reasonable or do these numbers include Gulag prisoners who survived?I know that it is difficult to estimate the death toll, but what are the most authorative sources on this subject?Can you help me find a reasonable range for estimation and the best sources to support it?I appreciate your help.   :Most mainstream western historians give a figure of 10-20 million; that is itself probably a considerable overestimate.  == Info box inaccuracies ==I think there something wrong with the infobox (the top one with the picture) and the succession boxes at the bottom. First the infobox says his term of office was from 1922-1953 (I assume we are talking about the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, here, so I added that in). But if we are talking about the office of General Secretary, how can we say Lenin was the successor, as Stalin was the first General Secretary? Also, I'm not as sure about this, but I believe all Soviet leaders following Stalin were known as ``First Secretaries``, so Malenkov doesn't technically work as a successor either, I don't think. Also, the successor box on the bottom for General Secretary is definitely wrong, as Stalin was the first and Lenin never held that position, he was the Chairman, and indeed granted Stalin his position. Didn't want to make changes without consensus.  :The ``secretary`` position was that of the top boss of the Soviet Communist Party. There is no reason to play technicalities about a particular ``office`` with a specific title. The issue is pretty confusing and there is no reason to put these intricacies in an infobox. At the same time, I agree that the formal details about party leadership must be addressed more carefully in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union article.  ::It's just that I assumed, with such specific info there, dealing with de facto leadership is tricky. Perhaps if the infobox said it was only leader, that would help. But that's not the common convention. For George Washington, to use an example of a first officeholder, we don't say preceded by George III, or whomever, just because that is the leader. Well... on second thought that's not the best example, because it's a different country. But what I'm trying to say there's got to be a better way to do it without implying that Stalin and his predecessor and his successor all held the same title.  == Modern opinion ==What about people's opinion of Stalin in modern Russia? It could be quite interesting.== Certain segments of the population ==removed: :, and by providing certain segments of the population benefits so as to win their support or co-opt them into the regime.What the heck these ``certain segments`` are? If bureaucracy is in mind, then this is of no special note: at all times in every state a bureaucrat lives better than a peasant. Apart of these (with a special subclass of apparatchiks), there were no benefitted segments.  ==Moscow==Minor quibble, but shouldn't the article at least mention, and possibly elaborate on Stalin's decision to stay in Moscow as German forces approached in December of 1941? As I understand it, practically every government official evacuated, but Stalin was adamant in his decision to remain. Seems a significant enough event to include here.  == Deportation of Romanians==I removed the following addition by an anon, about deportations of nationalities: Romanians (from Moldova), I have a very vague memories on the issue. If this took place, then it must be covered in  Population transfer in the Soviet Union in the first place.

The problem was after an administrator (not sure if it was you) looked at the book listings, and were happy they were neutral, about two weeks later, user , decided to sabotage the book descriptions, and add on some totally irrelevant, inaccurate and slanderous ad hominem attacks on the book's author, and he inserted them at the beginning of the book descriptions to try and discredit the content with a blatant ad hominem attack. The ad hominem attacks were removed, and then accusations by  were manufactured of having an ``edit war``, when he was the one to start trashing the page after it was approved.  was also the one to start a destruction campaign against the separate page that the critical links and books were on before. He appears to be very fundamentalist and not too concerned about using propaganda and slander to dissuade people from seeing any critical information. His accusations (beside being ad hominem) were also completely incorrect. Duffer appears not to give a damn about accuracy, or relevance, or the fact that ad hominem and propaganda are not acceptable on Wikepedia. JWs usually refer to this trashing and slander as ``theocratic war strategy``, basically meaning anything goes (including lies and slander) if the end result is to promote the religion. I have removed the ad hominem and I hope it will not return.  is also problematic in the same regard, as he appears to not realise when he is using propaganda, (or insults above) but is clear to see it when someone else may use it against him or JWs, demonstrating his interesting double standards (a sad, but typical Watch Tower Society characteristic).

0	`==Wikipedia style is for Wikipedia policy to determine==I have trouble understanding this conflict, people are saying such strange things. They're sort of understandable from a new user like Mr. Harvey, who seems unfamiliar with Wikipedia policy and principles, but I find them incomprehensible from a seasoned editor like Sam Spade. It seems to me self-evident that if Mr. Harvey controls the copyright, then we can't use the image other than under the conditions he dictates. And since those conditions include having an embedded, uneditable, caption, in violation of the wiki principle, that means we can't and won't use it at all. (That's  apart from the phrasing of the caption being IMO quite unacceptable—it's enough that it's uneditable.) Mr Harvey, it's just not the case that your regiment, or the Queen for that matter, is in charge of Wikipedia style. You seem to assume that all that's needed for your caption to carry absolute authority is that a spokesman for the regiment should ``clarify`` the form of address / title, that ``should`` be used, and then it will, it must, be used. You are wrong about that: forms of address and titles used here are matters for Wikipedia consensus and policy. Your employers are not empowered to dictate to the world how to speak. I can understand that you think they are, but I don't understand Sam at all. Sam, how can you see Mr. Harvey's demand to dictate the caption as part of an ``interpersonal conflict``? It's a conflict of principle. You write: I have recieved an email stating that Richard Harvey is the Photo Archivist at the Duke of Wellington's Regimental HQ, and that a condition of their usage is that the the name, rank & title be embedded. That is good enough for me, I see no reason to doubt that this is the case, or to refuse to utilise the images under these conditions.. Those two conclusions are miles apart. No, there is no reason to doubt it. Yes, there is every reason to refuse to utilise the image under such conditions. It's a pity Mr. Harvey has had second thoughts about the image he uploaded the first time, the one without a caption, and it's, well, just... odd, that he sees cropping off the caption as defamation, but we'll have to live with that.  |  `

Walker (BYU Professor of History), ::::::Richard E. Turley Jr. (managing director of the Family and Church History Department of the Church), and Glen M. Leonard (director of the Church's Museum of Church History and Art). ::::::The three were granted access to documents in the LDS Church archives. According to Turley, a file in the archives confirms that Lee was acting on his own. The file included the notes of a Mormon historian who, at the request of Church leaders, conducted a confidential investigation of the massacre in 1892. Turley said, ``There are very candid statements on the part of participants to a Church official under the agreement of confidentiality.``::::::While the trio found additional evidence of church leaders' culpability, Turley stated that ``Utahns elsewhere in the territory acted to preserve the lives of other troublesome immigrants . . . Unfortunately, the militia and church leaders of Iron County made different decisions, and their acts demand the strongest condemnation . . . Circumstance may explain their acts; nothing can justify them.``::::::The new sources the co-authors are using will be made public once their book is published. Turley said although the church is cooperating and is funding the research, the work is ``not a Church commission``; ``The idea to do the book was ours, not theirs.`` Publication apparently has been delayed as the co-authors have tried to be as thorough in their research as possible. According to Turley, LDS leaders share the authors' desire to bring all available evidence out in the open. First drafts of the book will be circulated for comment among LDS and non-LDS parties, including historians and descendants of the perpetrators and victims. ``Open, candid evaluation of that tragedy can produce catharsis, a cleansing spiritual renewal and healing,`` Turley said, adding that the authors will ``present the evidence as we find it - honestly, openly and candidly.``::::::The above is hardly an example of a brief description, and is far greater than the longest has ever been for the Franz books. I have put back a smaller concise, neutral description that should keep all happy. Posted Central 10 July 2005`

I am sure that it may seem that Poles are dealt many criticisms about Anti-Semitism, but that is no different elsewhere in the world.  Of course, the unique relationship between Christian Poles and Polish Jews is duly noted as causing your perception.  Most people consider the Poles as superfriendly to Jews, but in fact the Polish commoners had no special like for Jews.  These common misperceptions would be best cleared up, if you kept all terms neutral as possible.  We don't need people getting upset and wanting to fight back and forth.  Your own feelings about being discriminated against by inconsiderate Jews going on their rants about the Holocaust, don't belong in the focus of an article.  You have every right to feel upset about the Blitzkrieg and Nazi occupation of your land, including your upset attitude in being slighted by the ignorance of foreigners who think that damage to your people was neglible or meaningless.  It is their ignorance and apathy that keeps them from forgetting about your loss, but Poles don't shove guilt upon the world about the Holocaust as many Jews seem to do.  Take it from me.  I used to have many misconceptions about the Poles and Wikipedia has changed them.    `

0	`::PNRS, human. PNRS, human. PNRS>human. The only problem is that your analogy at this point no longer correlates to the real-world thing it was supposed to analogize. It isn't that we have detected PNRS's twice and found they were generated by humans, therefore the third PNRS we detect is probably human. Rather, the real world knowledge that we have around how life developed on Earth would describe an analogy that says we detected several PNRS's, and they all turned out to be generated by natural phenomenon. Somewhere in the ID article, it says that ID is not meant to replace (insert laundry list of evolutionary bits and pieces), and that those bits and pieces have already been shown scientifically to be part of a natural process. Those are PNRS's that were proven to be generated by an odd arrangement of pulsars, not alien lifeforms. The flagella on bacteria is just another PNRS in this analogy. And while we may not scientifically be able to explain them yet, we have several other complex PNRS's that we know were created naturally, so rather than leap to the conclusion that ``a designer created flagella``, science says ``no further information known``. There's a concept that feels like you aren't grasping here: science is patient in the face of an unknown. science deals with the unknown all the time. But just because something is unknown doesn't mean science finds it neccessary to leap to a conclusion or redefine itself. natural science has defined itself as empirical, observable, repeatable knowledge. And that's worked pretty good for the last couple of centuries, even though when the first natural scientists came about, they knew practically nothing, and everything was unknown from a rigorous, scientific point of view. If one were to look at ID from a purely scientific point of view and ignore all the political intent, ID is so impatient ``to know`` that it discards centuries of scientific practices to find some answer based on subjective measures like ``legitimate possibility`` or ``probable explanation``. Science is far too patient to give up so quickly in the face of an unknown natural phenomenon.  `

0	`-I'm currently interested in just the principles involved in the radio signal scenario... and what conclusions inductive reasoning leads to.I don't think it would be proper inductive reasoning to see a PNRS is caused by some intelligence, another PNRS is caused by intelligence, and to induce that the third PNRS is probably caused by some intelligence. There are unknown possible ways to generate a PNRS, and they cannot be ruled out simply because experience shows a couple other examples. This feels like the political approach to space shuttle launches about 10 years ago. Back in the day, designers speced the space shuttle to be safe for launch within a certain range of temperatures. Florida has uncooperative weather and often goes outside the safe range. Politicians wanted the shuttle to launch because it's good for elections. So, they pressure the upper management of NASA to launch outside the designed safe range. This happened a number of time without problem. At some point, management decided that the designers were wrong, and that a couple of launches outside their declared safe range meant that the real safe range was much wider. This continued for a few more launches until a space shuttle exploded on launch because it was too cold. If you shuffle a deck and pull 3 or 4 face cards in a row from the top of the deck, you can't really make any sort of probability measure as to what the next card will be. it could be a deck of only face cards. It could be many full decks. it could be a stacked deck. probabilities can't be determined off of a few rolls of the dice. two cases showing the PNRS was from an alien planet is not enough to make any sort of real probability estimate on the third PNRS. This is playing on a ``gut feeling`` that people have when they're playing roulette. casino's will post the last 20 rolls. Some gamblers will see these numbers and look for some sort of ``pattern`` and bet based off of that, on the ``gut feeling`` that the roullette wheel has some bias. They may even win a few times. But the casino is better off if the wheel is truly random, so any ``patterns`` is purely coincidental.  `
0	`:Well, first, I find it rather strange (to put it midly) that you agree to discuss it in the TALK page (since I asked to let's discuss it first please) but you go ahead and do a revert anyway and call this ``revert campaign``.  That aside, I left the note for the person who had reverted the article, but you responded on his/her behalf by saying  ``fine, let's discuss it``.  I find this also rather strange.  Finally, I don't see mentioning Pilz is Jewish to be controversial at all.  Iran's official response to this still unsubstantiated allegation has been that it is part of a Zionist media smear campaign.  Therefore, how could you say that the fact the Pilz is Jewish is irrelevant?  I see it as quite relevant.  I also don't see why mentioning a Jewish person is Jewish should be viewed as controversial even in normal course of events and contexts.  Really bizarre.   `

0	`:Is it scientific to attribute an event A, to cause B, where cause B was deliberate designed, with some sort of intelligent intent? Don't answer the questions beyond that::Well, the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. There are several major fundamental problems here.  ::First, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth. Natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here. This is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology. When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. No evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean, really.  ::Second, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with ``probabilities``. If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don't understand it, you can't do statistics on it. ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn't have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say ``well, it's so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it``. This is such a perversion of science. You can assign probabilities to something you don't understand. ID is just making up their numbers.  ::Finally, your example has A->B, where B was deliberate design. that's all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, ``B`` is unknown. Your A->B example might qualify as forensic science, if ``A`` were a dead body and ``B`` were a bullet in the heart. You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart, the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart, you can probably figure that's what killed him. You don't have that with life on earth. You have ONE scenario, ``A``, and you have no other cases to observe or test. So, in that sense, A->B is not scientific if you've never actually observed ``B``. (btw, B is teh intelligent designer, which has NEVER been observed). So, in that sense, no, it isn't science.  `
0	`::::Thats what the clause ``standard uncontroversial object`` implied. Ok, we're getting somewhere. Now, as I understand it, it isn't under contest that finding a supernatural causation will always breach empiricism. If I'm wrong, please inform me. Second, for our ``standard uncontroversial object`` does specified complexity or irreducable complexity hold any water? Remember, just keeping in line with our inorganic, manmade, unimportant and uncontroversial device. `
0	You hinted at it here  
0	`:::I would like to say all books, and web entries, should have some relevant description of enough content, or no one would know what the books where about. A single paragraph description of the content is not the same as a lengthy review. I think the current book descriptions are ok. If some Jws are not happy, why don't they put some 'positive' books in the positive section as a balance? Reducing book descriptions until they are meaningless, or so vague that no one knows what they are about, is a rather surreptitious form of direct censorship, or reader manipulation at the least, and should not be encoraged. We all need to be honest about our motives for ``this or that`` change to any Wikepedia article. I also noted a lot of accusations about POV this and that, but if we feel something is POV, surely we have to put forth a good and specific argument against the information, before it is changed to something else. Simply saying, ``X is POV, therefore I will zap it`` cannot be good enough. One has to give a specific proven point, not a rhetorical claim, but a factual one that can be proven, or it all just ends up like anarchy, and stifles any real debate or reasonable conclusions to debates. 12th of July 2005`
0	`You *ARE* indeed clueless. Yes, ``Ariana`` is a different spelling for ``Aryana`` which does indeed come from the Avestan's ``Aryanem Vaejo`` (specifically, in Vandidad, Fargasht-e Yekom).  But the ``Aria`` that you mention above is Greek for what is in Old Persian ``Haraiva`` which is modern Herat (Hari-Rud).  Looks like you can't even read and understand a simple text in front of you.  The Greek ``Aria`` has NOTHING TO DO with ``Arianem Vaejo``.  Not even a single scholar has ever suggested that Arianem Vaejo is the same as ``Haraivo or the Greek ``Aria``.  The Greek ``Aria`` for Avestan/Old Persian ``Haraivo`` is comparable to how in ancient greek text Hagmatana is written ``Ekbatana`` or many other examples. The Old Persian satapry Hari-Rud (which was not called Hari-Rud in Old Persian) is clearly mentioned in both Darius I's Behistun Inscription as well as two of Xerxes' inscriptions.  ``Arianem Vaejo`` on the other hand, is mentioned in the Avesta where I told you above, and numerous scholars have published works on the whereabouts of it (including our own late Dr. Bahram Farahvashi who has a full book by that title, called ``Iran Vij``).  Nobody (other than our great scholar ``Zereshk`` of course) thinks it is the same as Hari-Rud/Haraivo/greek ``Aria``.  As for ``aberoo``, I honestly feel sad for you, because your beahviour and edits in Wikipedia clearly reveal that you suffer from an inferiority complex and nearly all your edits are about image and not about contents.  It is obvious that you try to present an image instead of contributing to contents.  I suspect this has to do with the fact that you live in USA (according to your user page) and they have probably called you a camel rider or something along those lines, so this has resulted in the sort of pathetic behaviour that we observe from you here.   `
0	`::Indeed numerous Iranian media pointed that out right away.  That is why I support the idea of including ``Jewish`` at the beginning of that sub-section of the article.  It is not to ``single out`` Pilz because he is jewish per se, it is because both Iranian media as well as officials from Foreign Ministry have called it a part of the on-going Zionst smear campaign against Iran.   Pilz' ``early anouncements``,  had claimed that both final candidates of the Iranian presidency were mentioned in his ``extraordinarily reliable Agent D`` report.  So no matter which candidate won, he would have smeared the winner.   He had anticipiated that Rajsanjani wins (like most people expected) so he had initially put the focus more on Rafsanjani.  As an Iranian, I also feel this is coordinated. It is indeed hard to explain how the major Western media would be so quick to report all those allegatoins (which so far have turned out to be false) without even a cursory investigation. How could for example, AP, Reuters and AFP all three make the same mistake at the same time? And it wasn't even on just one allegation, it was on multiple.  So multiple News Agencies, making multiple mistakes that a pro would hardly ever do, all at the same time?  And I have seen a pattern like this for years on numerous other anti-Iran smear reports.  Also, you might notice how so many people involved in this very article are Jews or at least their edit history clearly shows their pro-Zionist stance.  I don't think that is accidental either, they are voluntary ``contributors`` to the same  smear campaign because they view Islamic Iran as a threat to Zionism.  The same people also have an ``interest`` on the Rafsanjani article and probably many other Iran-related articles.  `

To me, the real issue is whether the article is made better or worse by an edit. And while SlimVirgin may have fixed a verb tense or two in his massive edit, the overall result, including the deletion of important embedded notes being replaced by unfounded questions of accuracy and urban legend, made the article far worse than it was. Several other problems have been listed as well. None of which, apparently are problems in SlimVirgin's mind. Apparently they all make the article better. What we have is one massive diversion here. The article was made worse. But SlimVirgin can't admit it. Instead he will divert attention by saying his change was simply ``copyediting``, that I and another editor are trying to ``own`` this page, that it all comes down to editors like me inserting unsourced edits, that I'm POV, and finally that I swear too much. SlimVirgin, you have acted as nothing but a victim of your circumstances. You have not taken responsibility for a SINGLE thing you have typed on the article or the talk page.

I'm not particularly sorry about it, but I'll take down the language if people have that much of a problem with it. Every single other accusation you, SlimVirgin, have leveled against me is false. I have not violated NPOV on the article. I have not attempted to own the page. I mounted a personal attack by calling you an explitive, but I won't apologize since it was in direct response to you completely distorting my words into something I would never say. I would never say something as moronic as ``no dissent in the intro``.

Dr. Bernat's testimony was approved by the AAN Executive Committee. The two links provided document the testimony and the AAN approval.> SlimVirgin deleted this embedded note, and then inserts into the same paragraph, an embedded note questioning the accuracy of the quote.<Is this true? I seem to recall a case in England where a man woke up after a long time in PVS.><What levels of ``prognostic certainty``?: -``During this time, the Schindlers allegedly encouraged Mr. Schiavo to get on with his life, and he introduced them to women he was dating.``inserting the word ``allegedly`` might be technically not untrue, it casts a whole lot of doubt without any context. This statement about dating was reported by a guardian ad litem to the court. It is the guy's job to get the facts right, not present one pov. I can't recall, but I'm prety sure the guardian ad litem did not use the word ``allegedly`` in his report. and as far as I know, the Schindlers never challenged that statement at the time, either. Though I believe they may have challenged it much (years?) later, when they were willing to challenge anything possible.  There's a URL right by that line with an embedded note saying < quoting from page 11 of 38 of Wolfson report >, in case anyone was wondering where the ``alleged`` statement came from. -The noise awoke Michael Schiavo, and he called 911 emergency services. <I'm deleting ``immediately`` wherever I find it, because it's journalese and usually unverifiable, not because I think it wasn't immediate.>``Govorner Bush launched an investigation specifically into whether or not Michael called 911 ``immediately`` or whether there was foul play on his part.

0	`::Hi.  As I said, I have observed that pattern for a number of years (almost on daily basis) about Iran, because naturally I pay attention to what (and how) Western media report on Iran. I do realize the business and ``sensationalization`` side of it all and I agree with you on that.  But even taking that into account, still there is a clear orchestrated pattern.  And again, do you think it is just a coincidence that a bunch of Jews with clear pro-Israel/pro-Zionism edit history, such as  and  (an admin) and others, are focused on Iran-related articles such as this one and are insistent on spreading lies or intentionally misinterpreting things and doing all sorts of evil towards a certain goal?   `
0	`Ask yourself this: can an American TV anchorperson freely criticize Israel or freely speak his or her mind about US-Israeli policy without the fear of losing his or her job?  I don't think so, because now we live in a world that your TV and news programmes are viewed all over the world, just like you can view programmes from so many other countries.  In case of US politicians, the situation is even worse.  I think it is funny to hear Americans claim to be ``land of the brave and the free``  even the American president cannot afford to speak his mind about Israel.  The only good news is that many (if not most) American people are not quite well aware of this situation. `

0	`Hi again Bo [will just use the abbreviation for speed],Not much time at the moment since I'm in the midst of a project but wanted to respond to a few points.First of all, thanks for your kind, even-toned replies to my questions and expressions of  irritation. I DO think that WikiP should have an avenue of complaint for users  from my recent experience, it seems contributors can get stuck in an endless loop of Admins (or whatever titles you and your editorial colleagues have), never reaching someone with the authority to resolve complaints. You and others have referred vaguely to the ``process`` of Copyvio review, but I have no idea who does that, when they do it, or how to reach them to defend my position/claims.1. I sometimes find a ``You have a message waiting`` notice. How is that genrated? Do you get this same notice when I post on your User page? Is there a way to send a messaage directly to you so it won't be visible to the world  e.g. if I needed to provide you an email address or something I didn't want posted here?2. Regarding Crapsey. I did indeed check various sources in writing the article. And if you read the EB citation and my piece, you'll see that mine is quite different, not at all a sentence-by-sentence paraphrase. It differs in style and wording from the outset to the end and contains far more detail than EB. Moreover, Crapsey is a local legend in Rochester, and I had no need to consult Brittanica  I don't know how you folks access EB, but I stopped using it years ago when they went from a free to a pay service that only provides ``teaser`` articles that are virtually useless. Thus, the entry non-members get for Crapsey is the following truncated info:http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9125441We have never been EB ``trial`` members or subscribers; it would appear that you folks at WikiP do have some sort of membership, however. Is that correct?3. Regarding Sock Puppetting, I was adapting your own WikiP term for those who use ``dummy`` accounts (or have friends act in concert with them) to insure they get the posting they want. It was beginning to appear that your colleagues were teaming up in a Revert War. In fact, they did just that in another article we posted about area poet William Heyen  they kept Copyvio-ing it, though in fact it was written by us for our own journal, Exit Online. When I pointed this out, I was told, in effect, ``Oh yeah? Well, prove it!```` I have no idea what sort of ``proof`` one can offer for owning someone one has posted to their own web site (or any other web site for that matter). More to the point, THEY offered no suggestions as to how one might ``prove it.`` If you have an email address for someone at WikiP who oversees this sort of stuff, then let me know and we'll be happy to contact him/her.4. As for ``my article,`` I was referring to the fact that it's mine by virtue of the fact that I authored it. In fact, your own guidelines specifically state that the author of each edit is the author and has only granted a GFDL license, so that author can be said to be the owner of that particular edit. That could even be the whole article. For this reason, the authors don't have to comply with the GFDL requirements for their own writing - the GFDL license doesn't override their own rights to use their own work. They can also license it to any number of others under any other licenses they choose, since that's one of the rights authors have.5. Thanks for your candor over concerns about EB suits over copyright. Maybe EB has folks that spend their days doing nothing but monitor WikiP, though I somehow doubt it since they would not have access to the same ``new posting`` info that you and your colleagues use to monitor postings. It would take an army of staff even to randomly check WikiP listings.6. As for creating an account, in fact, my colleagues and I do have accounts and would, indeed, like the ``credit`` for our efforts. However, given the recent unpleasant incidents we've encountered that include threats of being blocked/blacklisted, I'm sure you can understand why anonymity seems preferable for the moment.7. I'll have to check into templates. I suspected you might be using some sort of boilerplate, and this is precisely why using forms can be so dangerous. `

He even confessed his guilt to the American people on national television.  Therefore the picture is real.  Unless you can prove otherwise, you can abuse your admin powers all you want to control the edits, but I won't believe you.   
0	`I agree that there should be some indication of Bach's significance stronger than that second sentence, as it is encyclopedic.  I'm still not happy with the word ``greatest``, because it's vague - and as you say it's an abbreviation, I'd really much rather include a modification of your expansion of the abbreviation above (I may try one day when I've more time).  I don't accept that ``everyone knows what it means`` - ``greatest`` means different things to different people, and there's too much of the peacock and the ``top ten`` about it.  And Britannica doing something is by itself no reason for Wikipedia to follow suit.  For now I modified the page according to this bit of NPOV policy.  Hope it's acceptable.   ♬  `

0	METs and Cooper Points.Cooper gives quite extensive tables of the points worth of various activities in his 'New Aerobics' book. Came out in the early 70s I think, in time to be avidly read by baby-boomers' jogging-crazy years. My understanding was that the tables were based on Cooper's extensive measurements of VO2 (?). IIRC The tables show that the training worth of a mile at 6 minutes and a mile at 10minutes are significantly different (nearly a factor of two IIRC).Now in various places on the web you can find the worth of various activities expressed in  Metabolic Equivalent aka METs. These tables seem to show that, once you've broken into a run at 5 to 6 mph, the higher metabolic rate of 6 minutes miling over 10 minute miling is nearly offset by the reduced time spent on the exercise - ie calories per mile is nearly independent of running speed. So what effect did Cooper measure to base his training tables on??If we understand it, should we include it?

At the moment, I have zero motivation to work on this because of, uh, other events. I will probably pick up where I left off before other events delayed our work on those two pieces.

0	`:::::LOL, I just have to reply to Danny Muse's reply to Elenap. It's not nice, but I have to speak. When will you get it Danny? Propaganda and logical fallacies are not a reasonable method of influencing people, especially if you are claiming to represent God and be a Christian, so why do you continue with them and your specious reasoning? All the points in your reply can easily be refuted. You said above: ``If text in one place is inappropriate or excessive . . .`` You have totally failed to prove the premise of your argument, but you then presumptuously assume that everyone will just blindly accept your wanted opinions as facts, and so you come out with a straw man argument about ``inappropriate and excessive``. You get the medal for surreptitious false reasoning. You then go on with another blatantly false statement: ``And as far as this section being POV, its title, ``Books Critical of the Group`` proves that it is by definition a POV section.`` Danny, how exactly is something that is 'critical' proof that it is biased or POV? You have failed totally to make even the most basic case for your assumed conclusions; you just jump there with one giant false leap. Criticism is not by default proof of a bias, POV, or non-objectivity as you incorrectly assume. For example, if you said ``five plus five is thirteen``, someone could objectively and neutrally criticise your ability at maths, and your conclusion, and prove you wrong, without having any biased point of view, or dubious agenda. Facts can be proven false or true, that is the rational basis of objective reasoning. Merely being critical is not a valid cause for rejection of the one criticising, as you manipulatively try and twist into its meaning with more ad hominem. You also ignore the hypocrisy of your argument, as Jehovah's Witnesses have masses of material heavily criticising other religions, so by your default, it should all be rejected as POV, biased, and highly subjective, and of little of no value. You have shot yourself in the foot Danny. You then go on with paragraphs of irrelevant red herrings, straw men, and more ad hominem character assassinations, in true Watch Tower fashion. You should read these Watch Tower articles on criticism and open-mindedness. :::::You come out with even more logical fallacies, by mentioning subjects that do not apply, and hoping the less knowledgeable reader will fall for your 'guilt by association' machinations. You speak about ``disaffected individuals, apostates, and anti-cult movements``, as if this somehow applies to Franz, when you have proven nothing. I'm sure I could get a host of quotes telling us all how sick and degenerate paedophiles are, and link that to you, and plenty of people would fall for that one if said over and over enough times, and the trick would have worked, no one would listen to anything you have to say if they believed you were messing about with little children. Your corrupt use of negative propaganda is disgusting, especially as you claim to be a Christian. I suggest you read your religion's articles on propaganda, you might learn to be more objective and less scheming in your arguments.:::::You then say: ``Especially suspect are ``Individuals who take up a cause for personal gain`` by publishing books, etc.`` LOL, I nearly fell on the floor with laughter with that one! Hey, Danny, look in the mirror! The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society makes nearly a '$$$Billion$$$ US Dollars a year, a large part coming from its massive literature sales, most to loyal JWs. They also dodge paying their taxes on that massive income, this depleting the local community of needed funds (except in France where they have to pay their taxes, and are calling on ``Satan's European governments`` to fight Jehovah's scriptural worldly tax arrangements, LOL). The greed of the publishing Watch Tower is terrible, but interestingly not a peep of condemnation from Danny about those Watch Tower ``Especially suspect 'Individuals who take up a cause for personal gain' by publishing books``. Pure gold from Danny Muse!:::::You then go on: ``There are not similar books listed on the WP pages for the Catholic religion. . .`` Since when did JWs love to link themselves with Catholics? Besides Catholics being a specially hated religion by Jehovah's Witnesses, it is completely different in its size, history and doctrines, and its treatment if those who criticise it. There are over 1 billion Catholics, and a 1500 year old religion, with massive tradition etc., why on earth would it be described the same as a 120 year old cult like prophecy obsessed group that treats its internal critics like demon possessed monsters, and then expels them and bans its members from

1	Then you're a communist, because you are not Zod like me, so you cannot have the same opinions on things as Zod. Boo yah.

0	I know that's not mature. And anyway, that was my cousin, I went to the bathroom, and he got on for awhile and was being an idiot. So don't talk to me like I did anything for I am Zod and I can break you, so leave it.
1	You ignoramus! My cousin just did the hitler pictures and the swastikas and what not. I've been the one talking to you you imbecile. I can't believe that people that are stupid like you exist. It makes we want to start playing russian roulette with myself.

0	`:::::::Hello Tom, thanks for your reply. You are correct; I should not laugh at Danny Muse, as it is more depressing than funny to see a cult-like mentality in action, especially on the doors, where many of the public can easily be fooled by Danny's type of false reasoning if they are not careful. I was not making a ``personal attack``, I was attcking his false reasoning. All my criticism of his false manipulative arguments, and deliberate attempts at deceit all still stand. Interesting, I see you do not criticise him for calling people ``idiots, and pigs``, why is this Tom? Is there one rule for some and a blind spot for others? Danny needs to realise that if he is to make a case, it has to be rational, not wild negative propaganda, and slippery false reasoning, regardless of his religion training him this way, it is not an excuse for him to use manipulative twisted reasoning here, hoping no one will perceive it. His veiled deceit and lying conclusions to incorrect points he makes all the time should be outed where seen. I apologise if I was rude as I was angry, knowing how many are sucked in by his religion's members specious and often twisted reasoning, but my points all still stand. Regards, Central.

0	 Danny, I have reverted your unjustified changes, as there are millions of people out there who have not given an opinion, and you cannot just throw what appears to be a tantrum because you are embittered by an argument with someone else. You alone do not possess the world's views. If someone got two people to agree with them that the entire JW page was to be banned and removed, would you allow this? Obviously not. The opinions of you, and one other, hardly justify or counteract the possible millions of views of others. Sorry, but you need to address your problems with the other poster, before you go removing text, as it looks like you are just being vindictive, which is not a tangible reason to edit anything.

0	`It's not that complicated.The extra harmonic power that they are generating is then filtered out, correct?Yes.So the filters are dissipating a lot of heat.No. People design the output filters of class-D amplifiers so they don't dissipate heat.Passive electronic filters are made from 3 types of components: resistors, capacitors, and inductors.In theory, capacitors and inductors do not dissipate *any* heat  only the resistors dissipate heat.So, people who design class-D output filters simply don't use any resistors. Only capacitors and inductors.(In practice, real capacitors and inductors have some small amounts of ``parasitic resistance``,so class-D output filters do get slighly warmer than room temperature.Still, the total heat generated by a class-D amplifier and its filter is still far less than any linear amplifier with comparable output power.)(So where does this ``extra harmonic power`` go, if it is not sent out to the speaker or dissipated in the output filter ? It is temporarily stored in the filter, in the capacitors and inductors. At some instants, energy flows *into* the filter, charging the capacitors and ___ing the inductors. At other instants, energy flows ``backwards`` from the filter, through the class-D amplifier, back into the power supply. This is why class-D amplifiers need a lot more/bigger capacitors on their power supply than other classes.) `
0	`== More on Protocols/Procedures/Courtesy ==Hi Bov,Thanks so much for your kind reply. Our discussion was getting so long it was unwieldy to scroll though, so I thought I'd continue under a new heading. Hope you have no objection.I'm still under the gun with that project I mentioned and am amazed that my last note was as long as it is!! Wanted to reply to a few points for the moment...I'm using numbered points because it makes it easier for you (and me) to refer back to.1. Regardingn my making a clear distinction between me/us and ``your editorial colleagues``, yes, you're right. I guess I don't know enough about WikiP yet, but I clearly don't have access to the same ``additional facilities`` (which I take to mean ``tools``) as you, so I don't have the same control.Sure, I could put a Copyvio on someone's page, but I rather doubt it would stay there any more than my {db}s did  I assume Copyvio notices are either 1. sent to all admins (or those who deal with Copyvios specifically), and/or 2. posted to the Copyvio page for you and your colleagues to make some sort of determination on. From what you say above, it appears that some Uber Admin(s) makes the final determination.2. Also regarding ``tools`` I and, I suspect, most WikiP contributors have no power to Lock and page to insure it doesn't get Reverted by anyone else. Nor can we Delete a page, even our own. Nor do we have access, as I assume you do, to EB and other pay services to check for likely infringements.There are even several services used by educational institutions which faculty regularly use to check for plagiarism in term papers, theses, etc. Perhaps you also have access to those? You didn't indicate how that EB page was accessed since the public can only get the ``teaser`` entry for Crapsey.Thus, to paraphrase your quote and the old axiom: ``we are all peers, with equal power to edit, but some of us are more equal than others!``3. Regarding your statement that it's ``actually relatively rare for a copyvio to be contested, and most pass without comment,`` are you saying that once a Copyvio is pointed out, the ``offending contributor`` simply concedes the point and allows the page to be removed without so much an objection?!! That's truly astouonding  I'd imagine that most folks do not deliberately borrow from others, however similiar the contents might be.Have no idea what you mean by ``the ones that are contested often end up in the sections at the top of the page.`` Can you point me to a sample of this?4. Regarding your statement that ``he EB page I'm referring to is , the one originally referenced  what do you mean? Referenced by whom? By your colleague?Or are you obliquely saying that WikiP has the means of reading contributor hard drive caches and Recent URL lists to determine where they've been?! I know I didn't reference EB and don't know how you access their pay service, but if you're in fact suggesting that WikiP can somehow monitor member hard drives, I'd find that VERY disturbing...an outright privacy violation. Will run AdAware & Spybot S&D; just to see if anything they regard as ``malicious`` turns up with WikiP fingerprints on it! ;-) 5. On your reply to 3 above that ``Wikipedia does not, in general, use text 'with permission,' `` I'm confused. The passage I quoted suggests that the authors are granting WikiP a GFDL ``license,`` which, from my understanding of the law, means ``with permission.`` The author still ``owns`` the material and, presumably can make whatever other use s/he wants of it but cannot expect payment from WikiP, restrict the editing of, or, for that matter, even withdraw permission for work submitted to WikiP.6. Regarding your answer to 5 above that you ``don't have access to any special posting info. It's all available to everyone, although some of it is better hidden or harder to use,`` this sort of relates to my #1 immediately above, and I guess I'm confused again. How in the world would Admins and other ``watchers`` like you (still don't know what your title is) know ``what's new`` on WikiP if you don't get notices or have some list you can comb through? Are you saying there's an actual public list of all new articles? If so, where is it, and what prompts you folks to check one article vs. another?Again, thanks. Will try and get back later or tomorrow. `

As even you should be able to see, an account was created by someone who called themself Anonm but they ceased using that name the same day they created it last December! There is no point in using IP addresses since 1000s of people can share an IP. And like thousands of other users, I don't always use the same IP or IP Block and really have no interest in reading your arrogant, insulting comments any more than you have any interest in my ``uncivil`` ones.

If you continue to sign your posts as another user I will start blocking you for impersonating someone else. No one has any ``bizzare grudge`` against you.

Should you continue this sort of harrassment, you may well find yourself blocked or removed from WikiP. But, by all means, proceed with your threat, which I guess mean blocking IP blocks!!  that will document your bizarre, unprofessional behavior.

0	`::Wrong again.  So far you have only based your claim on a web site.  Iranica does NOT say that Aryanem Vaejo is in Afghanistan, nor does Iranica say that any part of Afghanistan has ever been called Ariana.  If it does, paste the EXACT quote here WITH A LINK to that article.  The association of Afghanistan and ``Ariana`` for the FIRST TIME IN HISTORY appeared after World War II and this includes the name for their airlines ``Ariana Airlines``.  You seem to be of the mindset that no matter what, nobody should change what you put in the articles. This is indicative of poor upbringing by your parents. Your parents have produced a foolish Mr. Know It All who is not smart enough to distinguish between the real world and the our-son-is-never-wrong environment of his mommy's house.  This is stupid.  I have offered plenty of serious and verifiable examples that shows what you are forcefully injecting in this article is wrong,  but it seems that you are only interested in a stupid and stubborn childish game of just winning an argument at any cost, no matter what the truth is. Tell me which of the following points is wrong::::1- No reputable scholar has ever claimed that Aryanem Vajo is in Afghanistan.  :::2- One scholar, the late Professor Bahram Farahvashi, who dedicated his life to Iranian studies and has several respectable publications, including his award winning Dictionary of Pahlavi Language, has a book by the title of ``Iran Vij`` which is precisely about Aryanem Vaejo which Zereshk claims to be Afghanistan. According to this book, as well as other scholars, Aryanem Vaejo is next to the Caspian Sea.  Farahvashi also mentions the names of the scholars who think (and gives their reasons as to why they think) that Aryanem Vaejo is next to the Aral Sea.  In no case anybody has suggested it is in Afghanistan.:::3- In at least three of the Achaemenids inscriptions (by Darius I and his son Xerxes) where they mention the word Arya  (that is, the Old Persian word Arya) in the SAME INSCRIPTION they also mention Haraiva (modern day Herat which was recorded as ``Aria`` in Greek texts) as one of the provices under their rule.  The two words are DISTINCLY DIFFERENT words with different spellings.  Only due to the Greek rendering of Haraiva as Aria this confusion exists today (and even then, it surfaces after World War II, because someone found a way to associate Afghanistan with ``Aryan`` and others picked it up.):::4- Unlike what Zereshk claims, Encyclopedia Iranica DOES NOT say that Afghanistan is the same as Aryanem Vaejo nor does it anywhere say that Afghanistan has EVER been called ``Ariana``.:::5- Show me one authentic source from BEFORE WORLD WAR II, that shows any part of Afghanistan has ever been called ``Ariana`` or ``Aryana``.  Just one source would be enough, but it has to be an authentic and academically acceptable source, such a book from antiquity or the like, and NOT afghani web sites from the 21st century.  By repeating that the ``official afghanis website says so`` you only show how weak your argument is.:::5- Last but not least, in your revert message you offered the reason [this is] ``the OFFICIAL POSITION of The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan``  well, that is not good enough.  Wikipedia is an encyclopedia not the official website of Afghanistan.  What ``the OFFICIAL POSITION of The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan`` is irrelevant here.  We are interested in correct information.  `
0	== Other algorithms ==I've been looking around on the wikipedia and it seems that there are many algorithms that are left off this list (e.g. Levenshtein_distance, Longest-common subsequence problem). Has this page been deprecated by categories? (I still see value in this page as it adds short blurbs about the algorithms.) I'm asking because I'd like to add some of these, but I'm not sure where to put them without adding new sections (it seems a similar thing was discussed earlier). Ok, thanks!  
0	I'm not sure why you have added Metanarrative here, it doesn't seem very relevant to the topic. Also, it is incorrect to assume that either Metanarrative or Postmodernism are inherently left-wing. 
0	`OK Zereshk, thank you very much for suggesting that we should read the ``Aria`` entry of Iranics.  I paste your own EXACT link here ``(look up ``Aria``)``  please everybody, read his own link.  Look up Aria and in there it clearly says: ``ARIA, name of a region in the eastern part of the Persian Empire, several times confused with Ariane in the classic sources``  and it also explains more in two sub-items about this confusion.  `
0	`And it basically says what I have been saying all along that simply this ``Aria`` is a greek/latin rendering of ``Haraiva``. `
0	It's my first time on this page.  I'd like to express my support for MrSandman's (and Wiki's) position on rejecting misinformation.  While it is true that science cannot yet provide answers to some questions, and that we can find and merge many scientifically unestablished theories to try to explain events to our liking and answer those questions, those answers do not belong here.  There are probably other discussion boards and online communities to discuss them.

0	`===Ashida Kim===Fire Star, looks like the trolls are at work all over now, eh? Hate to bother you again with my little war but as you can see the Discussion thread toward the end is totally cluttered by this Sam Brown jerk. Even though I have made him and the others look like a fools, I'd just as soon not have all that trash online at all. At the very least block Sam Brown so I don't have to keep playing ``last word`` with him, LOLSpoke with Howabout1 a few days ago and he was kind enough to re-word some of the entry on me to make it less of a slam job. Would ask one other favor in that regard. Please remove the names given as aliases. First of all, they are not aliases, they are friends of mine, some of whom have already started getting harassing phone calls because the trolls know how to track down a name and have the area in which to look thanks to the details given. I compare this to the current ``outing of Valerie Plame`` in the news media. Revealing what the trolls believe to be my ``real names`` just encourages stalkers like the one I indicated above. Not to mention other people with the same names who might be targeted inadvertently. You might not think there is much danger from these miscreants, but, at the very least, the flame war with them on the discussion page clearly shows how rabid and dedicated they are to my destruction. Please consider this, thanks.Ashida Kim `

I guess you forgot that this was your first cliam (it's still on this page!).  You wrote: ``The Latinized term Ariana...is based upon Old Iranian Aryana- (Avestan Airiiana-, esp. in Airiianem vaejo, the name of the Iranians' mother country...)``.  I also copied the EXACT statement from Encyclopedia Iranica from THE VERY ARTICLE which you yourself were using to support your baseless claim, and now you are pretending as if nothing happened, and you are back to your long list of meaningless google-searched mostly-afghani obscure and/or personal web sites.  I will not bother to retype my 6 points above.  They are legit and every observer can see them.  Asnwer the points. Encyclopedia Iranica is more authentic than some personal web site from an afghan guy who somewho is happy to believe that Afghanistan = Ariana.   `

You know damn well that the term ``racism`` or ``racist comment`` doesn not apply in Iran in the same way that it applies in countries with true racist history, such as USA and many European countries.  The fact that you are using your familiarity with the English language to get a cheap ``winning point`` out of a lost game, tells us how weak and pathetic you are.  In absolutely BEST of circumstances, you can associate ``turk`` in Persian slang with ``ethnicity`` but if you really grew up in Iran as you claim you did, you know damn well what it is.  And especially ``torke tablo``, which you are.  Given your pathetic edit history of ``all image and no substance`` I repeat, I is hard to imagine a lower and less self-respecting Iranian than you.  You were born to be wannabee-western and as such, Iranians like you deserve to be jew-slaves.   `

1	`::You really are astonishingly stupid AND STUBBORN.  Moron, the four cities above are just 4 of many many many cities and villages in the HUGE province of the [Old] Khorasan.  And unlike what you think of the above four none is in Iran; and  Merv and Bukhara are not in Afghanistan.  What the hell is the point of mentioning only 4 cities out of scores cities? Modern Afghanistan is not any more or less ``khorasan`` than modern Iran or modern Uzbekistan or parts of modern Turkmenistan is.  You clearly have no grasp on this subject.  What can we expect from a Turkic mutt who thinks ``Fravahr=Ahura Mazda`` and thinks ``Aryana=Afghanistan`` and thinks ``Khorasan=Afghanistan``?   I honestly wish I had your brain .... I would feed it to my plants.  I am done with you, you are a complete waste of time.  Go ahead and put whatever bullshit you wish in the article and be happy that ``you won`` cuz your only aim seems to be just winning the argument at any cost, regardless of the facts, and that level of ``intelligence`` is more than I can handle.

0	To whom it may concern, it's true we haven't heard from all 6.whatever billion people on earth, nor do we need to. WP doesn't work that way, nor was it meant to. We have however heard from those WP editors that are interested in this issue. The result is a consensus of the majority regarding what this section should contain. That being said, personal attacks are inappropriate on WP and are certainly not persuasive or logical. I don't respond well to bullying or taunts. Enough said.

0	`::Dearest Danny, I see you have not replied to any of the points put forward in my criticism of your obsessive use of propaganda, unfounded accusations, slander, and your ad hominem attacks to name but a few of your methods. I herby challenge you to take three different examples from either of Raymond Franz's two books, and prove to us using evidence contained in the books that he is ``a bitter apostate, vindictive liar, makes inaccurate claims, and writes incorrect material about JWs, or the Watch Tower's Governing Body`` as you claim. If you cannot do this, then you should permanently remove yourself, and be barred from Wikipedia, as you have demonstrated, hypocrisy, slander and defamation of character, negative grossly subjective propaganda and multiple lies, all of which discredit your character, and your editing scruples as virtually worthless, and indubitably of no value as a contributor to Wikipedia, as you have proven over and over that you feel content to destroy someone's character (Franz's in this case), his motives, his books, and all without reading a single page of his written material. If someone did the same about Jehovah's Witnesses books, you would be outraged, disgusted, and we would never hear the end to it, you definitely would not stand for it. You would also have utmost contempt for someone who makes up lies, false accusations, and slander about JWs and their books, especially if they had never even read a single JW publication and yet they posted masses of negative claims about them, just like you have about Raymond Franz. YOU Danny Muse, are in NO position to speak, as you have not even read a single book by Raymond Franz, and so have completely and permanently revoked your right to speak, edit, or comment on the matter, of which you have admitted ZERO knowledge about him, his motives, his life or about his books and their Wikepedia entries, which you have the audacity to claim are ``inaccurate``, and yet you have zero basis for this false claim, but you still cling to it like a rabid Pit bull. Give it up Danny; you are biting at your own air filled fantasies and straw men. Wishing you well, and I hope you come back down to reality soon. Kind regards Central.

I had to use this account for my other one seems to be blocked right now for whatever reason.   `
0	`To all Wikipedia Editors of the Jehovah's Witnesses pages: FOR THE RECORD: I have chosen to not respond directly to Central's continued personal attacks on myself as that is quite obviously a pointless exercise in futility. Nevertheless, I felt an explanation might be in order for anyone else contributing to these pages. As Central is fond of pointing out ad hominem arguments are generally a logical fallacy. By the same reasoning anything he says about me is quite frankly irrelevant to the real issue, which is what should be included in the  Critical of the Group section. This has been discussed at length above. And, although we clearly we're not able to reach a unanimous agreement on the content, we did attain a majority consensus from those of the current contributors to this page that cared to express an opinion regarding what this section should and should not contain. Anyone that is curious can read the above thread whichas  has observedis ``quite prolonged``. That being said, I welcome any and all reasonable dialogue on the subject. But as long as Central continues his personal attacks on my character I will continue to undo his reverts without further comment.  `

0	`: FOR THE RECORD. Danny, you love to weave more straw men and avoid the real issues at all cost, as you have just beautifully demonstrated. As for me insulting you, it came because of you making provoking insults at me, calling me a `` hog and pig`` in one of your previous replies on 5 July 2005 15:46 (UTC). If you were using that kind of language with members of the public in the street, you would no doubt be quickly punished and hospitalised for your insulting provocations, and you have also demonstrate why many Jehovah's Witnesses who follow your methods actually incite hate against themselves and their religion due to their shameless insulting and provoking behaviour. You then make more revealing and completely false remarks: ``As Central is fond of pointing out ad hominem arguments are a logical fallacy. By the same token anything he says about me is quite frankly irrelevant to the real issue``. I pointed out to you, that when I insulted you it did not prove your argumentation wrong (you prove yourself wrong by your manipulative specious methods and lack of any evidence), so therefore, it was not ad hominem at all, but just an insult from your own provoking insults of which you appear to measure by another set of biased scales. Secondly, all the points I have made about your false conclusions and your false logic are all valid as they prove that you are not objective or reasonable at all, and have zero evidence to base your claims on, and are often very slanderous of others (Raymond Franz in this case) with no evidence to back your claims.:YOU Danny Muse, have failed to answer a single point of mine (a typical JW trait), which were about your logical fallacies, your use of slander, your negative propaganda, and your rhetoric. I have asked you again and again for proof of your statements and claims on Franz, and you have dramatically failed on all accounts to bring them on. Here again is the challenge summarized: I herby challenge you to take three different examples from either of Raymond Franz's two books, and prove to us using evidence contained in the books that he is ``a bitter apostate, vindictive liar, makes inaccurate claims, and writes incorrect material about JWs, or the Watch Tower's Governing Body`` as you claim. If you cannot do this, then you should permanently remove yourself, and be barred from Wikipedia, as you have demonstrated. . . your editing scruples as virtually worthless, and indubitably of no value as a contributor to Wikipedia, as you have proven over and over that you feel content to destroy someone's character (Franz's in this case), his motives, his books, and all without reading a single page of his written material. If someone did the same about Jehovah's Witnesses books, you would be outraged, disgusted, and we would never hear the end to it, you definitely would not stand for it. You would also have utmost contempt for someone who makes up lies, false accusations, and slander about JWs and their books, especially if they had never even read a single JW publication and yet they posted masses of negative claims about them, just like you have about Raymond Franz. YOU Danny Muse, are in NO position to speak, as you have not even read a single book by Raymond Franz, and so have completely and permanently revoked your right to speak, edit, or comment on this matter. . .. If you can bring on proof, then you can have an opinion that the book descriptions are 'this or that' etc., until then all you say is biased POV and unfounded. You have no right to say or edit anything on this particular subject, as you have demonstrated that truth on the matter and literature is not a subject you are interested in. Please read Proverbs 18:13. Posted Central 19 July 2005 (PS. I'm sure you will ignore all this and make up some more straw man to focus on to take the light off your complete lack of evidential backup to your claims about the books and Raymond Franz's character etc. The original book descriptions should stay, as they are brief, to the point, accurate, and give enough information to know the basic book's content. If you disagree then prove it, don't vandalize out of spite as you have been doing.)Also, I see ''' checked the entire critical sections and made some edits on 18 June 2005, and approved the extended book descriptions, which you have totally ignored, therefore it was a yes vote, not a no)`

I want to undelete that article, cause the deletion didn't fulfill any of the speedy deletion criteria! I also don't want to create bad blood. To be honest, between getting abused for the way I ran the GNAA VfD, being abused by Chocolateboy for my edits of the actual GNAA article, and feeling a might annoyed that my policy got deleted without a warning, and half way through the vote, I fear that the GNAA have won this round.

0	Forgive me also. I must be in attack mode all of the time on the Internet. It just sounded like you were poo-pooing any discussion of the topic.I'm not a newcomer, I have another account but I ditched it because it's tied to some articles I don't want to be associated to. I believe that, if there was enough interest, I could put together quite a case for my theory on who killed Trudy Monk. I've put a brief description on my talk page. Trudy's murder is a MAJOR part of the series, but since discussing it on the main article page would ruin the suprise which will come at the end of the series, I put it on my userpage. Lots of members use their userpages for things like that.  
0	Ah, now I understand - you're an old lefty who doesn't like the idea that Cairns had his funeral in Toorak. Well he did, and in a biographical article the fact is as relevant as any other. And it's either Adam or Dr Carr, by the way.  
0	If you're not an old lefty then you don't even have that excuse for this stupid deletion - at least old lefties are acting on their beliefs. This is a biographical article. The location of his funeral is a biographical fact, and since someone (not me) has seen fit to include it, it will stay unless a good reason is given for deleting it. On matters like this, yes, I am used to getting my own way and I usually do.  
0	I am now going to report you for repeated vexatious removal of relevant facts from this article, which amounts to vandalism. Have a nice day.

0	==Being blocked==So that's your idea of mediation, is it? R Lopez can run amok through Wikipedia with his lying crap, and I get blocked for stating my intention of stopping him unless Wikipedia's rather creaky structures do so. I've seen some silly things since I have been editing here but that would be the silliest.  
0	```Old lefty`` is not a personal remark, it is a political categorisation. The ``Old Left`` is a political category and is not related to the age of the person belonging to it. When the anon editor denied he was an ``old lefty`` I accepted that, as the above exchange shows. ``Stupid deletion`` is not a personal remark either, it is a characterisation of the editor's action. You may disagree with me but that's another matter. Why don't you mediate (if that's what you're here to do) on the substance of the matter (the deletion of factual material from the article) rather than wasting your and my time on trivia?  `
0	`I have now checked what I wrote: I said ``So more edit wars will be coming up unless Lopez can be persuaded or compelled to desist.`` I did not say that I would initiate or conduct such edit wars, only that they would happen. This makes your action in blocking me, even for a token period, all the more outrageous, and I think I am entitled to an apology.  `

If you say what they did was not vandalism, then ``134.161.244.89`` is exonerated too, as all he did was remove the biased revisions of others, who violated the 3rr as well.

0	: I heard sam (the author) on irc mentioning that the media wiki upgrade is what broke the script (it was working in the transition version, but the final one broke), but he's not home and it'll be about 10 days until when he can start fixing it.

0	I'm sorry that i must have misread the article. Now that I look back, the absense of ANY mention of WMD, and bush telling the public iraq had them is suddenly NPOV, where it was POV before. Silly me. Same with all the link between iraq and the 9/11 terrorists.... oh wait, i WAS right, they are not included because they are negative things about bush, forgot we cant have that here.

0	 Oh, i get it, if something is in one article, it CANNOT be in another article? even to provide context for the link? oh, ok. Give me a bit and I will start deleting EVERYTHING in the bush article that is in another article, and then NOT include links to it. Is that what you are saying? naw, you just dont like bushism because it is a truly neutral article that lets bush make himself look bad.

Varca, Chief Information Officer, FedCURE.FedCURE is the world's leading advocate for America's, ever growing, federal inmate population. On behalf of the Board of Directors, we would like to extend an invitation to each of you to join us in our efforts to reform the federal criminal justice system in the United States. Federal CURE, Incorporated, is a nonprofit organization that, inter alia, deals largely with the issues faced by federal inmates and their loved ones. We are working to reinstate parole; increase good time allowances;  provide for compassionate releases; restore PELL grants; and opportunities for successful reentry  into the community, for all federal offenders; and promote a system that incarcerates fewer people and provides humane conditions for those who are incarcerated or under post-incarceration supervision via parole or supervised release. Over 45,000 people were released from federal prison in the United States last year.  On this day, the United States Federal Bureau of Prisons houses 185,100+ people.  Most serving long, non parolable, sentences for non violent offenses.Please consider, if you have not already, joining and contributing to FedCURE.  We are the world's leading experts in matters relating to federal inmates.  Collectively, five of FedCURE's 14 board members have over 50 years of in prison experiencebehind the fenceas former federal inmates.   Each holding J.D.'s, two holding LL.M's and two holding Ph. D's.  Our lifetime members include the best criminal attorneys in the United States.  .``Martha Stewart's incarceration has made her the DIVA of federal criminal justice reform in the United States.``  Mrs. Stewart wrote from prison in a December 2004 letter posted on her Web site, ``I beseech you all to think about these [inmates] - to encourage the American people to ask for reforms, both in sentencing guidelines, in length of incarceration for nonviolent first-time offenders, and for those involved in drug-taking.``  The synergies behind that have yet to unfold.  However, we can state with confidence that, when all the discussions settle on the table concluding that the federal criminal justice system in the United States is undoubtedly broken and in need of reform; and that after all of the discussion about what's wrong with the system and what can be done to fix it comes to rest, in the end, it always comes down to one important reform issue:  To reduce federal prison sentences.  In today's political environment, however, there is only one possible hope that would best accomplish this reform:  Enact federal legislation to revive our former system of parole for federal prisoners; and to provide new re-entry opportunities for people being released from prison. To that end, FedCURE is feverishly advocating in favor of  H.R. 3072 (former H.R. 4036, as amended) a bill to Revive the System of Parole for Federal Prisoners, that was introduced, in the 109th Congress, by the Honorable U.S. Representative, Danny K. Davis (D) of Illinois on 27 June 2005.   Parole of federal offenders began after enactment of legislation on June 25, 1910.  Under the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, the United States Parole Commission retained jurisdiction over defendants who committed their offenses prior to November 1, 1987.  At the same time, the Act provided for the abolition of the Parole Commission on November 1, 1992.  The phase out of the Commission has been extended by statute several times. The status of the Commission beyond November 1, 2005 remains unresolved despite the Commission having taken over supervision of all DC offenders in addition to the remaining 4,000 Old Law offenders.  Presently, the Commission has over 100 employees and a budget of over $10 million.   H.R. 3020, introduced on 22 June 2005, seeks ``To extend the existence of the U.S. Parole Commission.When the U. S. Sentencing Guidelines were imposed for federal defendants whose criminal activities took place subsequent to November 1, 1987, parole was eliminated.  Early release was limited to approximately 47 days of good time each year and the sentences themselves were increased appreciably.  The majority of federal inmates are non-violent low-level drug offenders with very long sentences.  Moreover, the majority of this segment of the federal inmate population is being incarcerated for the first time. Thousands of people in prison are serving life sentences for non-violent offenses without the possibility of parole.  The vast majority of these people are also first time offenders.  Ni

0	` In the ``Findings and declarations of fact`` of the United States Congress in passing the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, in 50 U.S. Code Chapter 23 Subchapter IV Sec. 841, states that,``The Congress finds and declares that the Communist Party of the United States, although purportedly a political party, is in fact an instrumentality of a conspiracy to overthrow the Government of the United States...the policies and programs of the Communist Party are secretly prescribed for it by the foreign leaders...members of the Communist Party are recruited for indoctrination with respect to its objectives and methods, and are organized, instructed, and disciplined to carry into action slavishly the assignments given them...the Communist Party acknowledges no constitutional or statutory limitations upon its conduct...gives scant indication of capacity ever to attain its ends by lawful political means. The peril inherent in its operation arises not from its numbers, but from its failure to acknowledge any limitation as to the nature of its activities, and its dedication to the proposition that the present constitutional Government of the United States ultimately must be brought to ruin by any available means, including resort to force and violence. Holding that doctrine, its role as the agency of a hostile foreign power renders its existence a clear present and continuing danger to the security of the United States. It is the means whereby individuals are seduced into the service of the world Communist movement, trained to do its bidding, and directed and controlled in the conspiratorial performance of their revolutionary services. `

I think you have misunderstood the rest of the quote due to the non-standard use (or translation from Russian?) of the word ``resist.`` (which is understandable, unless you'd read the book.)  In ``The Kingdom...`` the word ``resist`` means the use of violence or evil.  I.e. chapter 1 title: ``THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE...``.

No; it ought to be taken in the exact sense of our Saviour's  teachingthat is, not repaying evil for evil. We ought to  oppose evil by every righteous means in our power, but not by  evil.The quote you gave, RJ11, means that Tolstoy supports non-violent tax resistance, but not resistance such as mugging tax-collectors.`

0	DID CHRISTIANS INVENT SATAN.The idea that Christians invented Satan is lies, propogated by some adherents of WICCA and other pagan believers, we see that the Holy Scriptures that came from Judaism has a book called JOB, so why blame the christians!, rather The Scriptures reveals in Genesis how EVE was tempted by the Serpent, who had refused to worship adam, also later we see that David is tricked into taking a census by SATAN (Old Testament 2 Samuel) later on further we see that Jesus himsels is accused of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul (Satan) by Pharisees, Jesus refutes the accusations of the Pharisees. In the NT we hear that I saw Satan cast out of Heaven as lightning striketh from the east to the West. So also In Revelations we hear that there was WAR IN HEAVEN and St. Michael and all the Loyal Angels to GOD fought against the followers of Satan and the Battle was won by the GOOD ANGELS, revelation also reveals, woe unto man for the Devil has come down to earth, being fierce and wrathful and know his time to be short! Also elsewhere we hear that Satan is likened to a lion on the prowl going to and fro throughout the earth to see whom he can devour. Christ was tempted by the Shaitan 3 times after his Baptism in the desert. So to say that We Christians invented something which was already revealed in Judaism and OT is silly and obnoxious. The Devil had pride, then disobedience, then Jealousy, then slander, then much later we learn that Jesus called the Satan a liar, murderer and thief.Why dont the WICCANS look to Zoroastriaism or other DUALISTIC Religions and see the concept of GOOD VERSUS EVIL in those religions? Why, so that the Christians get the blame for something that actually EXISTS. Even the Muslim believe in a the serpent called Iblis, and even buddhists had a concept for the Evil One called MARA, who was a TEMPTER. Jesus even spoke to St. Peter and said that the Devil had been given permission to sift St. Peter like wheat, whereby Jesus siad that he had prayed for CEPHAS such that he would not enter into temptation. The truth seems to be that the devil was an Arc Angel in Heaven, who became too full of himself, later whe GOD created MAN in HIS OWN IMAGE, GOD requests all the Angels to BOW to ADAM, all do except for ONE ANGEL (later called LUCIFER). He refuses based on himself being made of fire and that Adam is made of clay, however, GOD allows the satan to act as an adversary to mankind as can be seen in JOB, some mention that in ISAIAH: O Lucifer sun of the morning how thou art fallen from the Heavenn is a direct reference to the DEVIL, but I also consider it to BABYLOON, as in revelation, fallen, fallen is BABYLON the GREAT etc. Revelations has many warnings and prophesies concerning those who worship the evil one etc and their name are not written in the book of life. GOD has talks with the SATAN, so SATAN can not be inferred thence to be a non-entity, as GOD does not talk to non-entities. Also some people believe that the DARK SIDE of human nature to be some impersonal evil, others realise that this is negative non-sense. I know that people were possessed by demons, fallen spirits and that Jesus cast some of them out and they came out screaming 'Ha, Jesus you Nazorean, what hast thou to do with us, hast thou come before the alotted time to torture us!', Jesus then would tell the demon/s to shut up or be quiet! So far as I concerned the truth is in the Holy Bible, some truth is also in the Quran.There are some truths to be found also in other religious books, but the whole truth is Christ and the books of OT and NT are inspired by the Holy Spirit. Have a read of Revelation and read it aloud to someone and you will get a blessing from GOD! Enough of this rubbish about Christian inventions of spirits. Pagans invented their gods, and invented strange myths concerning their false gods.Jews and Christians had the opposite, GOD revealed to them the TRUTH and THE WAY, AND THE LIFE.Thanksemail: james_hernon@hotmail.comThe next seion is not written by me (James Hernon)

0	`do you accept the stereotype that women are innately less sexually driven than men? You write that ``Almost all transsexual women want the sex drive reduced significantly, and reasons for this are psychological. We are not becoming 'something else.'`` Yet if your sex drive is reduced significantly, then you ARE becoming something very unlike a real women. Why? Because healthy real women have sex drives just as strong as men's, if not stronger. You are becoming a man who has been chemically and cosmetically altered into a facsimile of femininity; a stereotypical pseudo-woman. You are NOT a real woman; you are a man with a low sex drive and clearly an equally low opinion of real women. You never stopped to ask yourself whether 'female hormones' would have the same effect on your adult male body as they do on genuine females. You never paused to wonder whether your male body requires different testosterone levels compared to a woman's in order to achieve the same level of sex drive. After all, one of the cardinal beliefs of the sex change industry is that men and women are different  right? So why do you consider these differences only when they favor your delusions? So `

And not a ``cleanse oneself spiritually`` kind of philosophy also . Well every question has an answer , as there is no effect without causality . The answer is right here , see for your self . , [] , [] , [] , [] , [] , [] , [] , []As you might have guessed , this is the tip of ice berg . A lot is going on , under cover . Being the followers of a cult , they dont show their intentions . This is why they use PM & not talk about it on forums now . These so called good faith editers are running a whole Project Wikipedia to attack each & every page associated with Islam . This has been happening under our noses for not less then 6 months , & now its officially made a project .There was a thread there which has been deleted by Sina . So for the benifit of all sane thinking people , I have added these threads to WP , so that if some muslim hacks FFI , & by some coincidence only these threads are deleted ( as Sina says ) , then these will be present as an evidence on WP . Now , *Do we want WP to become a mirror site of FFI . *Do we want phobic psychos to run around all over WP . *Do we want to explain the same things over & over again to people who always say that they are a newbie on WP , & want to make it better . After some time of copy pasting filth from their hate site, they vanish & some others show up with the same language , same mentality & same ``Stuff`` . I was also thinking for some time what happened to all venom spitting Sina-philes , & why are we now having some decent looking  people wanting to add their links to WP . Well that is also in the Sinan recommenddations of ``How to attack WP`` . U can all see Zeno's edits at Muhammad , & Jihad . The pressure to add a picture of Muhammad , pressure to add cresent as a symbol of Islam , Pressure to call Jihad bin nafs some mythical concept popularised by Sufis . Still in Jihad article , Zeno has changed `` Ibn taymia, scholar of classical Islam `` to `` Ibn taymia , The classical, militant scholar of Islam `` .  Dont you think he could have easily changed to ``Ibn taymia , the founder of Salfi thought in Islam . `` Do you think its coincidence , or lack of knowledge......nooooo , its called Agenda .Similarly nickbee , who just came here , saying he doesnt accept all that Sina says , but has has written lenthy posts pressurising to add their link . Would any body who doesnt care waste so much time on adding links , He also brought two well known trolls from FFI to back him up . May be its the new strategy , work in clans , one carrot two sticks  , & a lot of anon IPs . If we dont do something , these attacks will occur again & again , week after week , month after month . Its a big waste of time & energy . When I came here , I wanted to add some info about mysticism here . I havebeen here for 5 m

0	`== Andy/Homey's assertions ==``There has been an attempt by the MLC and to some extent by the Department of Canadian Heritage to rebrand the monarchy and remove any reference to it being at all British.``  Nobody, including the MLC or Canadian Heritage, has been attempting to cover up any ``Britishness`` associated with the Monarchy  this is part of Andy's conspiracy theory that I alluded to earlier.  What Andy/Homey is attempting to do with his out of context Rouleau quotes is deny that the Crown/Monarchy is an institution shared equally by all 16 Commonwealth Realms.  What the MLC, and perhaps Canadian Heritage, promotes as Canadian is only the Crown in Right of Canada  the Crown as it operates within the legal jurisdiction of Canada.``and legally it is not at all incorrect to refer to the Crown in Canada as the ``British Crown``.  Calling the Crown ``British`` for historical purposes, or due to the lack of a modern terminology for the shared Crown, is a matter of semantics, and does not affect constitutional reality that the ``British Crown`` as shared is not the same thing as the Crown within the legal jurisdiction of the UK.``Gbambino's unique belief that something can only be in context if the entire document from which it is taken is included.`` Complete ignorance of my earlier statement: ``You've admitted you specifically chose those quotations because out of their context they support your POV and 'original research'. You've conveniently omitted those (and deleted those) that don't because they provide more information and create a clearer picture about what Rouleau's point was  and it actually goes against what you're trying to assert.``  Context does not necessarily mean the entire document, it means enough of the document to get the proper point across.  Pieces chosen by a strongly biased individual do not constitute proper context.``he discusses everything *but* the actual content of the bullet point in contention.`` Ignoring your actions earlier and elsewhere does not provide you with justification.``Peter Grey seems to concede that the quote is relevent.`` Unfounded.``I suspect he does not want the quote there simply because he feels the reference to the ``British Crown`` is contrary to the view promoted by Canadian monarchists even though it is perfectly correct (as he, himself, has conceded elsewhere when he stated that in Canadian law there is no such term as ``Canadian Crown`` or ``Crown of Canada).``  What Peter asserted was that the ``British Crown`` as shared by the Realms is not the same thing as the Crown within the jurisdiction of the UK government.  This is accepted by Canadian monarchists as reality, but is not their creation!  As well, there is no such legal term as ``Canadian Crown,`` but the words ``Crown in Right of Canada`` and ``Crown of Canada`` are included in legal documents.(And Andy, it’s ‘’relevant‘’, not relevant – only mentioning that as vocabulary and spelling seem to be a sensitive topic for you.)  `

Thanks.   :The Canadian Crown Copyright is borderline: it appears to prohibit commercial use, and it may or may not permit modification.  It's still freer than ``fair use``, so if it's a choice between the two, the Crown Copyright image is better.  Such images should still be used sparingly.  The Canadian Heraldic Authority article is a good example of where Crown Copyright images can be used (although since it's the text description of a coat of arms that's definitive, not the visual representation, anyone could draw up a depiction of one of those coats of arms and release it under GFDL).  `

Not even all Arabic people are Muslim. And there is more evidence that Lewis based the Calormene god Tash on the false gods of the Old Testament, rather than Allah. If one reads the epic books the Arabian Nights and the Shahnama, I think they will find rather close resemblances between the characters/styles and the Calormenes.

I strongly recommend for you to delete these lies and falsehoods.   
0	`It seems to me, to use a Christian metaphor, that you cast the first stone.  Basically my attitude here is that it is not only good men who should be identified as Christians.  If someone self-identifies as a train enthusiast that is good enough for me.  If there is a Wikipedia category for train enthusiasts then he should be included.  The category is for ``train enthusiasts`` not ``good train enthusiasts``.  We have no need to examine the purity of his enthusiasm.   Besides, you are on a slippery slope.  In one Western democracy yesterday it was announced that more than 180,000 abortions happened last year.  That country is run by one who identifies himself very publicly as a Christian.  But he never speaks out against abortion.  He also took his country to war on false pretenses (he deliberately told lies) and in that war 20,000 innocent civilians have died who would not have died if there had been no war.  Using your argument Tony Blair cannot be identified as a Christian.   But I do not want to use your argument.  Nor do I think we should.  (But even if we use your argument we cannot see into Tariq Aziz's soul.)  That you (presumably another Christian) re-act with distaste that Aziz belongs to the same club is not the point.  Create a category for ``saintly christians`` is a possibility (although it would be horribly POV) and maybe you should exclude Azis from that category.   `

0	Tony Blair doesn't just claim to be a Christian, he is one.  That he is perhaps not the best Christian is my point:  He is still a Christian, but maybe not a good one.  Bush similarly.  There are countless Christians of whom many Christians such as yourself might not be proud, but they are Christians nonetheless.  That Aziz identifies himself as a Christian makes him one.  You are very probably right to believe he is not a good one.  And, of course, I too would be embarassed by him were I a Christian.   Wikipedia is not a Christian project (by which I mean to say nothing bad about Wikipedia).  Articles cannot be judged purely from a Christian perspective.  And certainly not only from one Christian's POV.  What now?  We seem to disagree.  I have sought others' opinions here.

0	`:What bothers me the most is your refusal to consider my point. I never said you don't use the quran. I said you're not an arabic speaker. If you were you'd realize that the tafaseer do not see this as an eclipse, nor does Yusuf Ali's translation match the arabic text. there is neither ``engulfed`` or ``buried`` or even ``darkness`` in the verse in question. There is only the verb khasafa, which means darkened. That's where the word for eclipse comes from ``khosoof``. The classical interpreters' work is good enough for me. None have suggested it's an eclipse, as i've pointed out in our discussion. As to the charge of personal attacks - I reject it. I said you're neither an arabic speaker nor a muslim. I may be wrong about the latter, but it's obvious you're relying on yusuf ali's translation rather than the original text. I've also said you're vandalizing the page I started, and violating its intent and philosophy.

0	 Italian Renaissance as a featured article ==Before getting to the substance of my comment, let me just thank you for all the work you've done for Wikipedia; users like you are such an asset to the project. I do have one minor critique to make, though... I noticed that you promoted Italian Renaissance to featured status, but at the time, I had an actionable (and in my view appropriate) objection. (Candidate page, with my comments) I objected to elevation to featured status on the grounds that there are stylistic issues in the article, missing commas, etc. I went through the first half, but haven't had time to fix the second half. At any rate, you probably just didn't see my objection; I'll do more to address it myself, but the style isn't up to par for our (rightly) high standards for featured articles.   ==

0	== Chemical Abortion ==Anon changed this section to:Chemical abortion, which comprises 10% of all abortions in the United States and Europe, is a method used to induce abortion by ingesting drugs, usually during the first nine weeks of pregnancy. Chemical abortion is accomplished by administering either methotrexate or mifepristone (RU-486) followed by administration of misoprostol. Approximately eight percent of these abortions require surgical follow-up, usually by vacuum aspiration (See below). Methotrexate may also treat undiagnosed or concomitant tubal pregnancies, or assist women who have spontaneously aborted.A common misconception is that emergency contraception, commonly known as the Morning-after pill, sold under the brand name Plan B, causes an abortion. This is medically inaccurate, since emergency contraception only works before pregnancy begins. Pharmacologically, emergency contraception is identical to ordinary hormonal contraceptives, and work to prevent pregnancy by delaying ovulation, inhibiting sperm motility, and possibly by making the uterine lining less hospitible to implantation. Emergency contraception has no effect on an existing pregnancy, and must be taken within 120 hours of unprotected intercourse, though it is most effective if taken as soon as possible. Intrauterine devices, also known as IUD's, can be used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected intercourse as well.Not going to RV this one because of WP:3RR, but I think it needs work. The content is pretty good, but the prose needs to be neutralized.

0	Adaptive OpticsA membrane mirror assembly is described that has a membrane deflected by a region of electrostatic actuators, consisting of conducting pads. The procedure for fabrication of typical membranes is described and involves evaporation of the material onto a substrate in a vacuum chamber. Parametric equations, developed from basic vibration theory, are given for establishing transient and steady-state performance criteria. Experimental data, using both titanium and nickel test membranes, shows that the performance satisfies the predicted requirements.

Also, your behaviour in Wikipedia clearly shows the half-Arab/half-Turkish blood.

And if you still have doubts, since you are from a mullah, sayyed family, I am sure you know that you can write to any of the ayatollahls offices or the howza and ask them any question you want.

You say I made personal attacks and the link I followed was the Qiyamah talk page..I presume you mean my comment that Universaliss was vandalizing it.

After you blocked me you didnt even rv his vandalism! I assume your decision to block me was an accident...but it does seem suspect...especially considering your recent and persistent need to engage me in convos which really dont concern you (Woohookity and that vfd consensus). I read your comment at southerncomfort's talkpage and I think you should know that I have not mislead her as i have never talked to this user. You said you blocked universaliss for a week...do you mean you blocked him/her yesterday and this will last for a week? No matter. I simply want that user to stop 1. reverting to old-outdated versions of the page which contain grammatical and technical inaccuracies, 2. stop the personal attacks, and religious attacks (towards Protestants, Jews, and Ahmadis), 3.and stop deleting information that he/she disagrees with. I really dont think this is asking that much. In terms of diffusing the situation...I tried to add in a passage that all parties could agree to.

0	As it's been a week, I've made the edits - the section was getting out of hand and becoming an essay. The revision I've put in place is probably a little tainted by my own POV, but frankly, I still think it's a silly argument and really ought to be removed totally.

I'm going to remove some of them, if enough people agree on this (I'll wait a week).*The whole issue of who was born in the Kaaba seems to be controversial. The section should go a little deeper into this. For example, where did the controversy come from ? Is it just a manifestation of the Sunni/Shia split or something else ?

0	` I was just sitting there, not doing a damn thing mind you, just quietly contemplating an inside story, when:1. a 10 year girl who was playing outside with her big sister on the trampoleen, said ``hey! whats that?`` 2. I ignored her, totally taken with the piece of chocolate in my hand, then I heard the word ``tree`` a few seconds later. 3. I crunched up my knees into a fetal postition and made sure my head was not visible while the little girl tried to show her sister what she had seen. 4. `` Hey! There is a man in the tree!`` Then a 13 year old boy who was playing hockey in the garden said: ``I cant see his face!``. 5 I quietly uttered a prayer of thanks for this. 6. Another girl about 15 years of age approaches and they all together start yelling things like: ``Thats funny!`` from little girl whom I had just recently seen dancing with headphones on in her sisters room. `` Waah! Hes too scared to come down!`` from the 13yr turd. In addition to many other jeers and such. 7. They carried on with their game while I developed cramp and was looking for a way to get down soon to relieve my discomfort. They occasionally ventured a glance in my direction. 8. After ten minutes, I started my descent as quickly as possible. `` Hey! Its a boy!`` from that darn little girl. I climbed faster and faster. 9. I fled into forest, squealing like a pansy.10. I hung about watching the tree to see if they were going to come near. They did not. I trod in dog faeces as I climbed into the car 15 minutes later.I am sure that they do not know of the paltform. Still, I suggest that we steer well clear of it for a week or two. Then do some serious camophlage work. I must make it clear that, although I take responsiblity for this mishap. I did nothing to attract their attention. This all happened on thursday the 28th. Cheers and by the way, welcome to Wikipedia!`

0	`== Some factual background on the subject that might speak to the credibility of the idea =='Logan Darrow' is actually Doug 'Logan Darrow' Clements.  He added the Logan Darrow to his name a few years ago.  After graduating from University of Rochester's MBA program in the late 80s, he went to the Pacific Northwest and tried a corporate job for about 6 months before departing.  He started a magazine, American Venture Capital Exchange, that had a modest amount of success matching entrepreneurs with investors.  He sold the magazine a few years ago and since then he has been trying to get his TV show, The Lexington League, off the ground.In my opinion, The Lexington League is basically a free-market, pro-liberty version of 60 Minutes.  Doug will disagree and point out the subtle ways that it is different.  I won't dispute the differences but I do think they are subtle.He ran for CA governor in the recall election in order to generate publicity for his TV show.  He finished 5th from the bottom.Fast forward to late June of this year.  I sent an email to approximately 6 of my buddies, including Doug, suggesting that we use eminent domain to take Souter's house from him in order to tear it down and erect a mansion, which would be assessed and taxed at a higher rate.  I later morphed this idea to be a bed and breakfast.  In the email, I specifically referenced getting another of my friends involved because he is one of the country's leading experts on property rights and takings.Doug sent me an email saying that it was a great idea and I would receive ``100% of the credit`` (not that I want or need the credit).  He created the press release and sent it out and after being interviewed on about 10 radio shows and getting 380,000 hits on his website, he sent me another email acknowledging his indebtedness to me for the idea.  However, he has avoided any public acknowledgement that the idea was anyone's except his own and he has declined to take advantage of my contacts including the aforementioned attorney as well as a friend of a friend who is a real estate developer.  This leads me to believe that he is not serious about the use of eminent domain against Souter and he is really interested in getting people to mail him money and increasing the public's awareness of his TV show.This is my conclusion.  You are welcome to draw your own.`

Is it any surprise that any country has a large tonnage of weapons considering nearly all nations possess armies?

0	`== film category cfds ==Hi - One way to read your notes at Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2005_July_28 (and I know you don't actually mean them this way) is that the anon votes are sockpuppets of .  Since this anon (whoever it is) didn't actually add the entries to CFD, I don't think it's inappropriate for him/her to vote.  And, if his/her ISP dynamically allocates IP addresses and the user want to remain anonymous, how would you expect him/her to vote?  Calling these ``sockpuppet`` votes seems a little overly confrontational.  Would you consider changing your note to be a little less insulting (assuming good faith)?  Perhaps something like ``user assumed to be the same as the user who originally added the cfd tag``?  IMO, accusing someone of being a sockpuppet is assuming some level of malicious intent, which I think is perhaps not warranted in this case.  BTW - in case you have any doubt, I assure you I am not the anon in question.     Hi, thanks for your message.  Actually, I had assumed good faith. I will change the notes on the ones that Kbdank71 ``added`` but the anon tagged.  The only reason I used the term ``sockpuppet``, is because if you actually read his votes, he insinuates that he is not the same person, yet they are all the exact same edits by each IP, along with the post on Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts stating he was not the same person.  I have tried to assume good faith, but he continued to remove Cfd tags, have categories requested to be speedied.  The only way I fealt the discussion could be fair, is if all were aware of the activities of the anon, although I'm sure most people realized it was the same.  Have a look at the log I created, if you haven't already .  I am not on a personal vendetta, I was in agreement with the anon about changing some of the cat's, but then it became ridiculous and we had to clean up all the bad-faith stuff that was done.  I will go change the way the comments read now.  Thanks again.   `

Of course, there are exceptions: for albums, singles, and DVDs, a low-resolution scan of the cover is always appropriate.  For movies, a still from a well-known scene or a low-resolution scan of a promotional poster is good.

0	`== Problems with Confucianism ==Confucianism is actually not a religion, but a set of philosophy. Confucious himself, like most of the Chinese in his time, had Chinese folk religion, but it doesn't mean his whole philosophy is a religion. Most Chinese don't consider it as a religion.It's somewhat like the confusion between 道家(the philosophy of Tao) and 道教(the religion of Tao). Lauzi's philosophy(the philosophy of Tao) is quite close to pantheism or atheism, while ``the religion of Tao`` was founded by 張道陵 as a polytheism religion. Although the founder of Tao religion worshipped and claimed that Lauzi was the ultimate pioneer of Tao religion, the philosophy of Tao is very distinct from the religion of Tao, and Lauzi himself never intended to be worshipped. (both are listed as ``Taoism`` in Wikipedia however)Confucianism and worshipping Confucious are distinct. Confucianism is the philosophy of Confucious, like the philosophy of Plato or the philosophy of Socrates, while worshipping Confucious is a part of Chinese folk religion, just like worshipping ancestors.`

Many quasi-tribal groups have extensive websites and make all sorts of claims, and post pictures with ``tribal members`` with politicians, but they are usually not ``state-recognized.``  State recognition is brought about by the legislature of the state in question passing a law recognizing the ``tribe.``  Governor proclamations and ``resolutions`` by state legislatures do not confer legal status.  In the alternative, a state can create an -agency-, much like a mini BIA, which is empowered to ``recognize`` tribes.  For a clear example, see the Alabama Indian affairs commission at http://aiac.state.al.us/.  I would venture to say that there are perhaps 6 state-rec Cherokee groups, in the strictest legal sense, in the entire United States.   `

I think Japanese naming and Thai naming could end up to different conventions, and that is good if there are sufficient reasons for that.

Titles in Britain when being examined in such fine detail have many ambiguities and many historical exceptions exist, and you will often find people making up the rules as they go along (e.g, a divorced Princess of Wales's title, the title of ``Princess Consort`` etc) which is why there is the possibility that either side of an argument MAY be right.

As the Wikipedia page says: ``. . .You can quickly insert inline references to web pages by inserting a URL surrounded by single square brackets; this does not provide as much information to readers, but it is much better than not citing your sources at all`` Interestingly, I see you have only attacked and vandalized the Quotes website, and none of the Watchtower's multiple links, no surprise there with your gross bias screaming from the rooftops. As for the links to Quotes websites, they are extremely encyclopaedic, and the 1975 page has no commentary, but lists all the printed material about 1975, so as to give fair and reasonable coverage, rather than just a few selective quotes. They are all given their source, publication, date and page numbers for proof and reference. Your apparent fear and terror that the public might actually read what the Watchtower organization has written is very revealing. You clearly have an agenda to vandalize and ban free speech when it doesn't suit your agenda, not dissimilar to your religious organisation. I suggest you look inside and see why now after many months, you feel the desperate need to hide accurate, comprehensive, dated, quotes, direct and unaltered that have been published by the Watch Tower Society? If you can give all the 1975 publications from the Watchtower's website, then I'm sure many here will be only to happy to list that link, but I think you will find they refuse to give any information to the public about their less than flattering publications, and that is where we all need to see a comprehensive and fully documented source like the excellent quotes site on 1975. You have failed to substantiate any of your claims about the quotes site; merely saying ``it's not useful`` is a deadpan POV with no basis but your own fear of reality, and your desperate urged to manipulate the public.

0	`Details2: I can understand that you would like to have the whole thing rewritten to cast a more favorable light on TFI but your statement that nothing is all black or white does not fit with regards to your description of FFing. Berg's letters, his language, Marias language and letters, letters such as ``Make It Pay`` ``God's Whores``, The King Arthur Series, and many many more, make it clear that FFing was prostitution with a sordid twist of Jesus being behind it all. I think if someone from NAMBLA said ``Our detractors say we molest little boys but we say we show them love, nothing is black and white`` that a minority of people, probably molesters themselves, would see it that way.I don't think the public gets a fair view of TFI since they don't have access here to read for themselves the full content of those letters and many others. Letters like #3029JNR- Loving Jesus Part 3-JETTS is but one letter that has statements showing that certain practices should not be revealed to outsiders. If TFI has nothing to hide, ``Burn After Reading`` letters would never have been necessary. Despite precautions, publications continue to leak from TFI as people jump ship. Until the family ``secrets`` are known and not denied, only then can true discussion occur about what TFI is, was or is to become. -Warheit`

0	REPLY: Many distributors say not to use chlorine bleach nor cationic sufactants (fabric relaxers, fabric conditioners).  AIUI too high a concentration of bleach may distort the fibers [please confirm].  The cationic surfactant will fill the holes in the microfiber and reduce its efficiency.Similarly microfiber should not be washed at too high temperatures (eg 80 celsius).  However it is hard to get microfiber to release the dirt it holds and so the method of washing needs to be a bit of a compromise.Do not wash with other garments especially those which shed small particles of fiber as these will be taken in and held by the microfiber cloth.There does not seem to be a case for using special detergents.Again, some will advocate using a drier but the temperature must not be so high as to distort the micro fibers.  I would not want to iron or press washed microfiber because of the possible loss of the dirt traps.Some distributors will suggest the use of bleach (eg 3M and its Scotch-Brite microfiber kitchen cloths) and others will specify rather high temperatures.  Perhaps their microfibers have been treated or manufactured to withstand such washing but I am not sure how it could have been achieved.http://www.microfiber-products-online.com/faqs.html
0	Ahm. Would the title of this article seem to be a POV and an endorsement, of a pretender or actually a reconstrued pretender????  
0	Please do not imagine things. There is no clear consensus for moving. And, sadly for you, you are not allowed to restrict people to vote only those alternatives you want.  
0	`Basically, the multi-propose Approval Voting we recently used, is designed precisely for that. Approve an alternative means approval, no vote to an alternative means oppose. The result gives that or those alternatives which have highest net voter number, just as Irpen wishes with ``approve & oppose``. The only basic structural weakness of Approval Voting (if voters are honest) actually is that it is not designed to register priority order of a voter and thus not whether an individual approve vote is strong or weak. But even this can be made by enlightened voters, they just need to write ``weak approve`` or ``strong approve`` when voting for any alternative - and the interpretation will be the task of the interpreter. However, what happened with the (yet ongoing) vote is not due to weaknesses of the voting system, but due to the problem that our subject is difficult to name in a generally accepted way. She simply is difficult. There are reasonable, sufficiently-well-founded arguments her to be placed under headings which almost all make some to oppose. And thus the vote splits. This being the basic situation, NO VOTING SYSTEM will ever cure it - unless using ``violence``. Of course a voting system could be designed which favors something and violates some others, and thus a decision will be made - against half of the population who are then totally pissed at. Such voting systems were used by dictators, by oligarchs, etc.Personally, I am somewhat puzzled why not a higher number of people came and put their (perhaps secondary, or label ``weak``) approval to ``Alexandra of Hesse`` - but that is the result of the will of those voters.  `
0	`==Dubious addition==:Caltrops are used inside some atomic bombs to center the uranium or plutonium ``pit`` inside the spherical tamper. The air gap allows the tamper more time to accelerate, which compresses the pit more tightly and leads to more efficient fission.I find this to be very unlikely  for something as highly-engineered as an atom bomb, I'd think they'd use something purpose-built.  `

0	`==Present Day Canada Government website incorrectly Titles BNA Act 1867==The Government of Canada (mainly Liberal since 1963) is very ``skilled`` at practising the Sin Of Omission as shown in the linked text below,British North America Act 1867http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/c1867_e.htmlThis website incorrectly refers to this document as the Constitution Act 1867, which is a misnomer, and a shameful one, indeed.:http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/endnts_e.html#(2):(2)  As enacted by the Constitution Act, 1982, which came into force on April 17, 1982. The section, as originally enacted, read as follows: ::1. This Act may be cited as The British North America Act, 1867.   I disagree with your interpretation.  You're reading a footnote, which merely says that *originally* the 1867 act was to be cited as the British North America Act 1867.  But, under the law since 1982, it is now to be cited as the Constitution Act 1867.  All acts forming the constiution were retroactively renamed.  Judicial decisions, and subsequent legislation, use this new naming system.  This reflects the fact that these documents were not a part of a ``constitutition`` when originally created, since Canada had no consitution until 1982.  Collectively, these acts were turned into a constitution, and hence renamed.   :What?::``Canada`` had no Constitution until 1982?::You are completely wrong as well as per retroactive re-naming, that is not what happened at all.  Please get your facts straight. `
0	`Howdy rob,You wrote above,:I disagree with your interpretation.Fine, the Dominion of Canada, is a free country.  The ``footnote`` was not the basis of my arguement.   Constitutional Law does not afford the retroactive re-naming of terms within a Constitutional Act.   Each term that is repelled must be specifically indicated.  Each Clause that is replaced, must be explicitly indicated.Your grasp of Constitution Law and procedures is complete ill-informed.  Do you have any idea the Constitutional Chaos that would be created in any present day independent country, that has used as a basis English Common-Law as a template?

You very very professional, easy going and nice to talk too.  However, SimonP and GroundZero have seen fit to arbitarily deem my additions as ``POV warranting Deletion`` without any discussion.  I am not happy about such ``blatant editoral presumption`` on their parts.  I have have no prior dealings with GroundZero, but I am ``well acquainted`` with SimonP's style.   He loves to add material without references and that retort that they are available in comtemptary Newpaper Articles.   A claim that is quite difficult to double check, as most people are not career librarians, or such.  At any rate for the time being, I have taken the liberity to move my Republican Tricolour contributions to a separate page, linked below,See also French Republican Tricolour form of Canadian Maple Leaf Flag.Just to let yaa know, any blatant deletion/editing of this new page or the link to it on the Flag of Canada page, and I shall be asking you to contact the Administrations TO LOCK BOTH PAGES for Dispute Resolution.Take care, and best wishes eh, `

0	== Osho: leader, controversial, religious movement ==In TFA it says: 'was the founder and leader of the Osho-Rajneesh movement, a controversial new religious movement'. He said (at least as far as I read in his books) that he was nobody's leader and didn't seek to lead anybody. You can say that a bunch of people following you around makes you their leader, but that makes it your own opinion. Also, he said (again from the books) that he was not a Rajneshee and had nothing to do with the Rajneshees, that he was only a guest of the Rajneshees. The term 'controversial' part may seem opinion but it is right, as osho repeatedly said (again from the books) that he wanted to be controversial and stir things up as much as possible. As for the religious movement thing, he bashed religions like no one else ('all religion is utter crap' or something to that effect) so I think that labeling him as a willfull starter of a religion is somewhat of a mistake... Maybe the 'rajneshee cult' separate page was actually a good idea, at least it would be a good place to put some osho book quotes about his stance towards the people that followed him around, about free will, etc.

Mmmmmbo had me over to the Biff Rose site, as I have written some music criticism. I went over to his website, and was surprised to find some lyrics that could only be construed as racist. I ordered a disk, from old, and got one from new, and it is quite clear the later years has been a hateful time for Rose. It's important not to let your own opinions ride through the entries, so I have added words such as detractors and critics, though Willmcw keeps adding niceties that make it seem as as if the whole of Rose's ouvre was happy go lucky. It is not, and so should be noted, this strange turn toward angry old man, with particular venom toward minorities. I have also noticed that this 'other' Steve Espinola has his own website linked to Biff Rose's and therefore is probably what you call on here, a sockpuppet. the connection between the 'other' Espinosa and Willmcw is not as clear, though they seem to communicate with some regularity. I hope all who read this will check out Rose's music, old and new and his mulittude of websites, because the answers are inside his words and web presence. In regards to email, I can email you form my earthlink account. It will identify me as Esteban 'Steve' Espinola. Ok. thanks

0	```The most likely danger is a few hundred or low thousands more will die. But the nature of terrorism is that it relies on people not realising that they will die anyway, with probability 1; and the chances of getting struck by lightning are literally higher than dying from terrorism. But guess which one has the press and the politicians acting on it? Not lightning. That's the real point isn't it? `` That is a ridiculous point. There is no War on Lightning simply because there are more deaths caused by lightning strikes that happen about by natural causes. We are at war with willful guerilla groups and states that sponsor activities to over throw or terrorize stable governments. The difference now then was then is that the Bush administration has called it so a war, and has opted to use the military along with the FBI and the CIA.  The War in Iraq was not about oil. That is speculation. You can try to ``prove`` it with all the shoddy evidence you have that probably points to other things, that you try and twist to fit the picture that it was about oil. The war was about upholding UN Resolutions dealing with Saddam Hussien to account for his weapons of mass destruction. The onus was sqarely on him and he failed to comply. The only thing that terrorism had to do with Iraq was that Saddam had ties to terrorism and could employ the use of terror if he was desperate. The case for the removal of Hussien was being discussed even in the Clinton administration.  This situation is so easy to comprehend. I dont know why is has to be tripped up by global oil crusades and tales of maniacal conservatives that want to rule the Earth through their multi-national corporations. Dont you find it odd that the ones spouting this non sense are the anti-globalization crusaders with neo-Marxist tainted glasses that see profit and global finance as the ills of society? And anyone who disagrees with their world view in politics is ``in`` on the action?

It lead to amusing references to some of his works. And it had the added benefit that the Americans got straight away !!

PS.Please see my talk page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ariel_Sokolovsky for copies of the emails between me and Eliezer to understand why he is so determined to keep these links deleted.`

From this and his previous public statements his followers ``extrapolated`` that he acceded to their wish that he be the ``Messiah``. But that moment never arrived, as he died unable to verbalize and say anything to confirm his followers' longed-for dream that he be the actual long-promised Jewish Messiah.``1)The Rebbe encouraged public singing of Yechi Adonenu Moreinu v'Rabbeinu Melech Hamoshiach l'olam voed! - ``Long live our Master our Teacher and our Rabbi King Messiah forever and ever!`` as early as 15th of Yiar 5751 (29th of April 1991) almost a year before his 1st stroke see this video clip for example: http://video.moshiach.ru/events/first-yechi.rm in it you can clearly see Chassidim singing Yechi and the Rebbe encouraging them in Yidish to sing it once more.beyond that look at this clip again before the Rebbe's stroke Mrs Chavah Cohen is giving the Rebbe tambourine with ``Yechi`` writen on it the Rebbe gives her a blessing http://video.moshiach.ru/events/yechi-tambourine.rm`

The Church of England (today know as Church of England, Anglican Churhc, Episcopalian (in the USA, and Scotland) was thus created in 1534.  Since Henry was of Welsh blood, he took power over both England and Wales in Personal Union.  Henry confiscated all Roman Catholic Church Lands (well 90%) in England and Wales, and transfered them to the Church of England.In 1536, the Act of Union of 1536, formal merged the Parliamentary Powers of England and Wales, whose seat of parliament is todays British House of Commons.  Thus, the Personal Union lasted only two years (1534-1536), and the formal Legislative Union of England and Wales lasts to this day.

The result will be the same in either case.  Differentiating with respect to Zload::For a maximum or minimum, the first derivative is zero, so:or:In practical resistive circuits, Zsource and Zload are both positive.  To find out whether this solution is a minimum or a maximum, we must differentiate again::This is positive for positive values of Zsource and Zload, showing that the denominator is a minimum, and the power is therefore a maximum, when Zsource = Zload*. >

0	`==New Outline of British History== Recently, Dr. Goldstein said.  ``One tends to think of England as Anglo-Saxon,`` ``But we show quite clearly there was not complete replacement of existing populations by either Anglo-Saxons or Danes. It looks like the Celts did hold out.`` British historians have generally emphasized the Roman and Anglo-Saxon contributions to English culture at the expense of the Celtic. A recent history of Britain, ``The Isles`` by Norman Davies, tried to redress the balance. The Celts were ignored, he noted, in part because no documentary histories remain, the Celts having regarded writing as a threat to their oral traditions. Generations of historians saw British history as beginning with Roman invasions of the first century A.D. and indeed identified with the Romans rather than the defeated Celts. ``So long as classical education and classical prejudices prevailed, educated Englishmen inevitably saw ancient Britain as an alien land,`` Dr. Davies writes. The new survey indicates that the genetic contribution of the Celts has been as much underestimated as their historical legacy. Dr. Davies said in an interview that ``traditionally, historians thought in terms of invasions: the Celts took over the islands, then the Romans, then the Anglo-Saxons.`` ``It now seems much more likely that the resident population doesn't change as much as thought,`` he continued. ``The people stay put but are reculturalized by some new dominant culture.```

That that song was co written Oscar winning musician Paul Williams is important. Also of note, it should be mentioned that Rose has disavowed the Williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website's message board he admitted he was falsefying William's own involvement in the song. But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose's appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officially appeared on the show, and how many times he taped performances. He alleges, himself, that he appeared on the show 12 times. Producerss from the Tonight show remember him being on with much less regularity. Therefore, a distinction, to leave out embrassment, would be something like, ``Rose appeared with some level of regularity on the tonight show in the end of the decade.`` Of note> Rose was banned from any more performances on the Tonight Show because he refused to cut to a commercial break during his last performance, reciting a poem he often claimed as his own, which in fact was a poem by Paul Newman's uncle, Joseph Newman. This was chalked up to Rose's irrascible nature. I think it is important to notice to, the anger that first rears its head here, and then seems to pop up, on the record he did in 73, and beyond, to his later self released recordings where Rose is heard calling african americans niggers, and making fun of the jewish religion, citing Hit5ler as a genius, who clearly  had a vision. Willmcw is trying to keep the previous words someone else wrote about Rose being a child molester, which were clearly vandalism. I did not write that, and the anti semitic sentiments attributed to Rose are very easily found in his records and his websites. Willmcw is a vandal and works against my own edits in a nasty and un wiki fashion. ==Greetings==Greetings and welcome to wikipedia.

Are Other performers non accesible recordings listed? NO.Do a better job editing and less of one POlicing because you stink at it.== Redirect ==The article at Biff rose is improperly-titled because it is not capitalized correctly. Please leave it as a redirect to the properly-named article. Thank you. - == What the? ==Hey, why are you reverting my edits and removing the photo of Biff Rose? I found a separate article on the same topic (where you seemed to be the main author), incorporated the main points from it in an attempt to mege them. Someone later redirected it.  Why are you deleting my additions?  However much I abhor racism, anti-semitism, etc. I think that whatever Biff Rose currently espouses seems more like it should be taken with a grain of salt. Not quite the same as David Duke.  I have no problem with these things outlined in his bio, but it should really not have the form as something showing a personal point of view.  It seems like the way the article was, was fairly balanced, showing both old and new aspects of the artist.  And let the quotes and links speak for themselves.  Why did you remove all that other stuff which you deem extraneous, by the way? Having the name of some songs and collaborators seems rather harmless.  But anyway, I don't really have any particular agenda in the matter, I just don't like random deletions of what I write.   Hey man, you have got to get a more broad sided view of the reality. what your writing only proves that you are a sock puppet for the Rose crew, and that you are unable to realize that wikipedia is a group process and that your words will be eidted no matter what, it's the nature of the beast. If you don't like the process move to some other site that protects your version of relaity as the truth. Good luck finding that place, brainiac.

0	: Okay, while I agree with the first point, that the previous header title is more appropriate, I must say that I'm kinda alarmed by your second contention. Your POV on Timothy Leary is of course valid in your own right, but to generalize and dismiss him and his ideas from this article doesn't seem to be fair. It is not our duty to figure out what material is subjectively valid or not. I have taken both a literature class and a criminal justice class on the undergraduate level that included a subtantial section about Leary, his reasearch and ideaology; He's defintely notable. Even though I might not susbscribe to all of what he believes, I still think that it would be incomplete to write him off as a crazy just because that's how his image is perpetuated today. To make wikipedia the best resource, we may want to include Leary's conclusions, but ensure that readers can get the complete picture about him, and his work, so they can make up their mind on their own. C'est vrai, non?

0	`== My thoughts on the Scrabble word list ==I understand the opinion of many is that I messed these lists up, but in my opinion this is not the case. Not only does the list now contain many more, genuine words than it used to, but I've incorporated the definitions, stated the irregular plurals, such as qawwal hooked by I, and so on. To me it seems the only genuine concern with the new page is capital letters. Knowledge of irregular plurals such as fuqaha is useful, as is the fact that somehow we must categorize or otherwise sort these words so that they have a genuine meaning, a genuine context, which others can believe, research or add to.I've already said to others, if they feel the words should be in lower case go ahead and do so (I was hoping I could get these words up in courier or some other consistently spaced font, but this appears to be impossible, thus meaning I would further understand the wish to make these words lower-case). And I'll consistently make my case that these words do exist, I've cited my sources, and the justification for the fact that each of these words exists. Yes, I'll admit that words like bathqol (which I'm happy writing in lower case for now), draw very few Google hits, but I was writing from an amalgamation of sources melded into an individual source, which is justification enough for me that they should be included in this list. I hope you think this is okay. I'm going to ask  whether he would update his opinion as stated on the talk page.Meanwhile, I am of the opinion that, although perhaps obscure to some, the dictionaries I have cited are genuine dictionaries, with genuine words and should be treated as such. Please respond with your opinions.PS. Maybe as I have earlier in this statement, the right thing to do would be to reproduce the list in bold lower case, rather than regular upper case, so as to upset fewer people. |Edits`

As to arbitrarily removing contents, AFAIK I never have or do, thank you very much, so I think that's a bit over the top. If I was going to stubify the article without discussion, I would have done so, and you probably would have just reverted it.

Read the following quotation:``The central tenet of the Glottalic Theory of the Proto-Indo-European obstruent system is that what has been traditionally reconstructed as a plain voiced stop series can be more convincingly reconstructed as a series of ejectives, which are inherently voiceless. However, the abundant evidence that this series was voiced has led to outright rejection by many of the Glottalic Theory. In an apparent attempt to obviate these objections, Frederick Kortlandt claims to have found ample comparative evidence that this series underwent a change from ejectives to implosives to voiced stops in several branches of Indo-European. In this address evidence will be presented to demonstrate that Kortlandt's implosive model is fraught with implausibility and inconsistencies and should also be rejected.``(Simpson Humanities Center)So, the evidence that Germanic (aspirated or not) *p *t *k, as well as Armenian non-aspirated *p *t *k stand for original voiced stops is abundant.

I want it to open the page, and will keep it here, because I feel it acentuates the writing that follows.so, without any further ado, here is some biblical goodness.THE BEST THINGS HAVE BEEN CULMINATED Zeal to promote the common good, whether it be by devising anything ourselves, or revising that which hath been laboured by others, deserveth certainly much respect and esteem, but yet findeth but cold entertainment in the world.  It is welcomed with suspicion instead of love, and with emulation instead of thanks: and if there be any hole left for cavil to enter, (and cavil, if it do not find a hole, will make one) it is sure to be misconstrued, and in danger to be condemned.  This will easily be granted by as many as know story, or have any experience.  For, was there ever any-projected, that savoured any way of newness or renewing, but the same endured many a storm of gainsaying, or opposition?  A man would think that Civility, wholesome Laws, learning and eloquence, Synods, and Church-maintenance, (that we speak of no more things of this kind) should be as safe as a Sanctuary, and out of shot, as they say, that no man would lift up the heel, no, nor dog move his tongue against the motioners of them. For by the first, we are distinguished from brute beasts lead with sensuality; By the second, we are bridled and restrained from outrageous behaviour, and from doing of injuries, whether by fraud or by violence; By the third, we are enabled to inform and reform others, by the light and feeling that we have attained unto ourselves; Briefly, by the fourth being brought together to a parley face to face, we sooner compose our differences than by writings which are endless; And lastly, that the Church be sufficiently provided for, is so agreeable to good reason and conscience, that those mothers are holden to be less cruel, that kill their children as soon as they are born, than those nursing fathers and mothers (wheresoever they be) that withdraw from them who hang upon their breasts (and upon whose breasts again themselves do hang to receive the Spiritual and sincere milk of the word) livelihood and support fit for their estates. Thus it is apparent, that these things which we speak of, are of most necessary use, and therefore, that none, either without absurdity can speak against them, or without note of wickedness can spurn against them. Yet for all that, the learned know that certain worthy men [Anacharsis with others] have been brought to untimely death for none other fault, but for seeking to reduce their Countrymen to god order and discipline; and that in some Commonwealths [e.g. Locri] it was made a capital crime, once to motion the making of a new Law for the abrogating of an old, though the same were most pernicious; And that certain [Cato the elder], which would be counted pillars of the State, and patterns of Virtue and Prudence, could not be brought for a long time to give way to good Letters and refined speech, but bare themselves as averse from them, as from rocks or boxes of poison; And fourthly, that he was no babe, but a great clerk [Gregory the Divine], that gave forth (and in writing to remain to posterity) in passion peradventure, but yet he gave forth, that he had not seen any profit to come by any Synod, or meeting of the Clergy, but rather the contrary; And lastly, against Church-maintenance and allowance, in such sort, as the Ambassadors and messengers of the great King of Kings should be furnished, it is not unknown what a fiction or fable (so it is esteemed, and for no better by the reporter himself [Nauclerus], though superstitious) was devised; Namely, that at such a time as the professors and teachers of Christianity in the Church of Rome, then a true Church, were liberally endowed, a voice forsooth was heard from heaven, saying:  Now is poison poured down into the Church, etc.  Thus not only as oft as we speak, as one saith, but also as oft as we do anything of note or consequence, we subject ourselves to everyone’s censure, and happy is he that is least tossed upon tongues; for utterly to escape the snatch of them it is impossible.  If any man conceit, that this is the lot and portion of the meaner sort only, and that Princes are privileged by their high estate, he is deceived.  ``As the sword devoureth as well one as the other,`` as it is in Samuel [2 Sam 11:25], nay as the great Commander charged his soldiers in a certain battle, to strike at no part of the enemy, but at the face; And as the King of Syria commanded his chief Captains to ``fight neither with small nor great, save only against the King of Israel:`` [1 Kings 22:31] so it is too true, that Envy striketh most spitefully at the fairest, and at the chiefest.  David was a worthy Prince, and no man to be compared to him for his first deeds, and yet for as worthy as act asPreface to 1611 Translation iv ever he did (even for bringing back the Ark of God in solemnity) he was scorned and scoffed at by his own wife [2 Sam 6:16].  Solomon was greater than David, though not in virtue, yet in power: and by his power and wisdom he built a Temple to the Lord, such a one as was the glory of the land of Israel, and the wonder of the whole world.  But was that his magnificence liked of by all?  We doubt it.  Otherwise, why do they lay it in his son’s dish, and call unto him for easing the burden, ``Make``, say they, ``the grievous servitude of thy father, and his sore yoke, lighter?`` [1 Kings 12:4]  Belike he had charged them with some levies, and troubled them with some carriages; Hereupon they raise up a tragedy, and wish in their heart the Temple had never been built.  So hard a thing it is to please all, even when we please God best, and do seek to approve ourselves to every ones conscience. If we will descend to later times, we shall find many the like examples of such kind, or rather unkind acceptance.  The first Roman Emperor [C. Caesar. Plutarch] did never do a more pleasing deed to the learned, nor more profitable to posterity, for conserving the record of times in true supputation; than when he corrected the Calendar, and ordered the year according to the course of the Sun; and yet this was imputed to him for novelty, and arrogance, and procured to him great obloguy.  So the first Christened Emperor [Constantine] (at the least-wise that openly professed the faith himself, and allowed others to do the like) for strengthening the Empire at his great charges, and providing for the Church, as he did, got for his labour the name Pupillus, as who would say, a wasteful Prince, that had need of a Guardian or overseer [Aurel. Victor].  So the best Christened Emperor [Theodosius], for the love that he bare unto peace, thereby to enrich both himself and his subjects, and because he did not see war but find it, was judged to be no man at arms [Zosimus], (though indeed he excelled in feats of chivalry, and showed so much when he was provoked) and condemned for giving himself to his ease, and to his pleasure. To be short, the most learned Emperor of former times [Justinian], (at the least, the greatest politician) what thanks had he for cutting off the superfluities of the laws, and digesting them into some order and method?  This, that he had been blotted by some to be an Epitomist, that is, one that extinguishes worthy whole volumes, to bring his abridgments into request.  This is the measure that hath been rendered to excellent Princes in former times, even, Cum bene facerent, male audire, For their good deeds to be evil spoken of.  Neither is there any likelihood, that envy and malignity died, and were buried with the ancient.  No, no, the reproof of Moses taketh hold of most ages; ``You are risen up in your fathers’ stead, and increase of sinful men.`` [Num 32:14]  ``What is that that hath been done? that which shall be done; and there is no new thing under the Sun,`` saith the wiseman: [Ecc 1:9] and S. Stephen, ``As your fathers did, so do you.`` [Acts 7:51] HIS MAJESTY’S CONSTANCY, NOTWITHSTANDING CULMINATION, FOR THE SURVEY OF THE ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS This, and more to this purpose, His Majesty that now reigneth (and long, and long may he reign, and his offspring forever, ``Himself and children, and children’s always) knew full well, according to the singular wisdom given unto him by God, and the rare learning and experience that he hath attained unto; namely that whosoever attempteth anything for the public (especially if it pertain to Religion, and to the opening and clearing of the word of God) the same setteth himself upon a stage to be gloated upon by every evil eye, yea, he casteth himself headlong upon pikes, to be gored by every sharp tongue. For he that medleth with men’s Religion in any part, medleth with their custom, nay, with their freehold; and though they find no content in that which they have, yet they cannot abide to hear of altering.  Notwithstanding his Royal heart was not daunted or discouraged for this that colour, but stood resolute, ``as a statue immovable, and an anvil not easy to be beaten into plates,`` as one [Suidas] saith; he knew who had chosen him to be a Soldier, or rather a Captain, and being assured that the course which he intended made for the glory of God, and the building up of his Church, he would not suffer it to be broken off for whatsoever speeches or practices.

However, WGKF believes that the story of GKIF is wrong and is only told in that way so they can promote themselves better. The true history NEEDS to be told in the article about WGKF. It's their viewpoint and therefore important information for an understanding of the way WGKF thinks, trains and deals with the situation.

0	`==Proposal of changing name and structure of this page ==I propose to change this page and show in it only reference links to various comparison charts, because it fails to show (as stated in the title):[Quote]The table only includes systems that are widely used and currently available. Due to the large number and variety of available Linux distributions, all of these operating systems are grouped under a single entry in these tables.[End quote]It could have been called ``Comparison table of OSes recent than 5 years``, but it still presents MacOS and not only Mac OS X, that is the current selling version.(For example Windows'95 and windows'98 are both canceled from the table, and only Windows ME is shown. And it is correct. because both 9x versions are discontinued from market longer than 5 years.)OS/2 is discontinued, and IBM plans to release it Open Source, but it is still on the table.Linux OSes are shown apart. Their invoice is no longer (?) necessary.It lacks of OSes still on the market, such as AmigaOS, which recently started also 2 split versions, AROS and MorphOS (and also MorphOS it is currently on the market).[I wrote AmigaOS invoice in the table and I planned to insert MorphOS later].It lacks of very interesting OSes currently on the market such as RTOS (Real Time Operating Systems), which major representative is QNX.Also it could have been called ``Comparison Table of Operating Systems with a million or larger userbase``, but then, FreeBSD and Solaris are far from reaching this record of installed releases. So I propose to create multiple pages of comparison charts, and this page pointing with respective links to each of them (Historical chart ones, OSes actually on the market, Linux Only, etcetera).But one chart amongst the others must be a very extensive comparison table showing all existing OSes, present and past ones, to be of reference for all readers, and mainly students and scholars.Criticisms and advices are welcome.Insert your Sign and say why, if you agree or refuse to change this page.   [Whoops. Sorry. I am Raffaele_Megabyte, and I failed to log, becase I reconnected internet after a brief pause]: In my opinion the tables should list OSes that are widely used. However, use isn't the same as number of installed systems; that number just boosts desktop operating systems out of proportion. If, for example, a Solaris system runs an application server used by 100 users, that would really have to count as 100 users, not just one. A good measure might be how often an OS or services running on an OS are directly or indirectly used by how many users. Or to put it another way, the amount of ``real work`` done using that OS. (Of course this cannot really be measured, only estimated).: Basically I'm all for including OSes like QNX and similar systems, as right now the embedded operating systems are very under-represented. However, if we were to go down that road all the way, then we'd have to start including e.g. Symbian OS or Windows CE, too, and there isn't really much point in comparing e.g. Symbian OS to Solaris.: So if there was to be a split at all, I'd split it by target system type, i.e. server OSes, workstation/desktop OSes, embedded/realtime OSes. With that kind of split, many systems could be clearly assigned to one of the types, instead of having to maintain the same data multiple times. Also, splitting into multiple tables doesn't necessarily mean splitting into multiple articles. For example, it would be possible to simply have one section per target system type.: In either case, I'm very much against doing this kind of change in the ``reorganize first, fix later`` style, since a lot of changes tend to stop after the ``reorganize`` phase and never get around to actually filling in all the new content (E.g. I've seen a fair amount of people who insist that OS xyz has to be in the tables, but then can't actually be bothered to add more than a sketchy version of the ``general information`` data.): Instead, I suggest you create the reorganized version as a page in your user namespace, and then post a link here for discussion.   `
0	`==reversion undone==No good reasons were given for removing my changes, and both they and I have been falsely described. I am not an academic. Nor do I believe that ``only people with european nonmedical academic doctorates deserve to be called doctor``.The only kind of doctorate is an academic one. Doctorates may be in medicine or any other subject. This is clear from the article, which the reverter appears not to have read properly.As for 'European', there is absolutely no Eurocentrism in the article. The US (a country with about 5% of the world's population) is exceptional in that bachelor's-level degrees in medicine are on paper called 'doctorates'. I left mention of this exception in the article. I believe, however, that it requires some explanation for those who might not be familiar with its exceptionality.So that's three lazy errors already in the reverter's blurb: calling me an academic; saying that I think those who don't hold European doctorates shouldn't be called doctors; saying that I think those who hold medical doctorates shouldn't be called doctorates.Fourth, I left a lot of it as it was.As for 'perspectives', I have no 'perspective' to offer. I was trying to keep to the facts. It is true that there is a history to this article, but this includes for example the mention by one discussant that 'doctor' is used as a noun to denote those with PhDs as well as to denote those who hold bachelor's-level degrees in medicine. That fact was not mentioned in the article itself before my changes.(It might also be mentioned that the use of 'PhD' to describe a person, as in 'John is a PhD' is not encountered in the UK - at least, not in my experience. You would say 'John has got a PhD).My version can doubtless be improved, but this will best be done by those who have read it and considered the merits of the particular changes.People read encyclopedias to learn new facts. Whilst I am not saying that this one should be prescriptive, this does not mean that ignorant beliefs should not be countered. For example, I have met people in the UK who think that medics are 'doctors of medicine' and that people with doctorates are 'doctors' of some other subject, as if the qualifications were on the same level. That they aren't, is a fact, not an opinion. (The exceptional case of the US MD should of course be covered too, and is).`
0	`: Everyone falls short in discussions compared to Tiger, who does have ten majors to Singh's three. Plus, Singh has also only really distinguished himself as being the second best golfer in the world behind Tiger since 2003. I think his age works against him a bit too, he was a late bloomer, and he is 42 now and it's not clear how much longer he's going to be at the top of his game. Popularity is a complex factor and there are always going to be a lot of reasons, not just one reason like he's from a different country. It's certainly possible that Singh gets a bit less attention than he might otherwise because he's not American, but recall when David Duval hit #1 in the world, it's not like he got a huge amount of attention for that. As for the ``Tiger wasn't doing his best`` line, that gets brought up with a lot of other golfers than just Vijay Singh. Re. the Google test, some other golf stars: Mickelson (744,000 hits), Els (349,000), Goosen (251,000), Nicklaus (760,000), Palmer (880,000), Garcia (326,000), Duval (120,000), Faldo (137,000).  `

0	` Bad crap ==What bunch of crazies wanted connection to the Force to be mystical instead of genetic? Movies like these shouldn't be mystical! It's about the happenings in a fictional galaxy, not some weird spiritual garbage! The only time it should be spiritual is if it were referencing Christianity, and referencing it correctly at that!  :I, for one, am an atheist and don't believe in all that spiritual crap myself. However, I think that mysticism in stories makes them much, well… better. It also enhances the theme.   How does it do that?  :Scorpionman, what makes you think that a movie should only be spiritual if it references Christianity and not another religion? —   I suppose that depends on your point of view. I'm not relativistic, but when it comes to things like science fiction, there's no need for spiritual stuff.  ::In fact, I was disappointed when I learned that the Jedi use some mystical substance that can't be measured scientifically. It would make more sense for me if they were just highly-trained concentrated people. -  :::The Jedi don't really use the midi-clorians. The midi-clorians just connect them to the Force, and the Force is what the Jedi use.   ::::By ``some mystical substance that can't be measured scientifically`` I mean the Force. I'm quite disappointed by its very existence in Star Wars. -  I don't really think it needs to reference ANY religion. Science fiction is science fiction! If you think it needs to reference Islam, that's your opinion.  :I don't think he ever mentioned Islam.   ::I am not sure to whom the anonymous editor was referring (I don't see any reference to Islam either), and I suppose this discussion isn't really relevant here anyway. But for the record, I have no problem with spirituality without reference to a specific or already-existing religion, especially in something like Star Wars where the connection of the ``humans`` to us is obscure (since it takes place during ancient times in a distant galaxy). I was responding to Scorpionman's odd (in my opinion) comment that movies should only be spiritual if they reference Christianity instead of other religions. I personally think it's better to stay away from specific religions. —   I really would rather have it not reference spirituality, but my ``weird comment`` stating that it should only reference Christianity is my point of view. I know not everybody agrees, but I really would rather it all be purely technological and scientific.  :The Force is a power that can not easily be conceived, my young padawan. We must learn to harness its energies, let it flow through us. Only then can we become one with the Force.   Is Yoda really an atheist?  :Yes. He worships the Force.   Oh.  7 July 2005 11:34 (UTC)==`

It may seem unfair, but the burden of proof is not on the skeptics, they have the easy job, the consensus was correctly criticized for being unable to explain the satellite data and the residual balloon discrepency.  Now they are in better agreement, but the discrepencies are still great enough to call into question the range of IPCC predictions.  Perhaps the injustice in the burden of proof is compensated by the greater funding and employment on the ``believer`` side.  The skeptics can get by with far fewer people and less funding for research.  Model the clouds better, model the data better, and couple the ocean better, and better incorporate direct and indirect solar influence and the error bars should go down.  Do all that and even if the predictions come in at the high end of the range, the Kyoto treaty may still be completely ill advised and a tremendous waste of human wealth and potential.  It just ain't fair!   I hope you agree that it is fair to demand better science when hundreds of billions of dollars are being committed on the predictions.

I took a look at how your RFAr was coming along, as well as your evidence you are marshalling in your ``Sandbox`` at [].  I must say I am rather disappointed at the slight nature of said evidence.  Not that I'm going to be around, but I'm sure you don't have a very strong hand, as it were.  As I've said before, I've already explained the alternate accounts, and users Casito (and Soltak also to a smaller extent) have been just as uncivil to me as I had been to them.  Casito basically accused me of being a pedophile/stalker of some kind in his statement to the Arbitration Committee after all.One thing that did seriously concern me and that I'd like to, if you please, elucidate, is that Casito's statement about ``website defacement`` being a ``crime`` in ``many jurisdictions`` is absolutely 100% misleading in our context.  First, there are no local jurisdictional issues here, the Internet is regulated at the national level in the U.S.  (I'm sure you knew that).  Second, like I told Casito, this is a Wiki, any changes on here, no matter how malicious, do not rise to the level of ``defacement,`` which pertains more to secure/static websites (think US Govt homepages for instance).  I don't know whether he realised this, but in practical terms what Casito said was misleading on both legal and practical grounds, a bluff if you will.  Of course he didn't realise that I could see through his bluff, and when I calmly explained these two above points to him, he got really defensive and quite ``pissy,`` just as I'm sure he would in real life.  Just between you and me, he just doesn't seem like a really ``cool kid.``For you, however, I have the utmost respect, being a liberal arts Professor in the only civilised part of the U.S. as far as I'm concerned.  However, you might want to hurry up presenting your evidence, since I'm once again leaving the country at 8:55 am tommorrow and won't be back until next month; and as I said on my user page, I won't be editing on Wikipedia any more after I get back to work and my routine, etc.But take care, don't take any crap from those snotty preppy know-it-all kids you have up there (and how would I know about that hmmmmm????) )!! `
0	the normal style for these talk pages. Did you know you can generate the signature by typing four tildes: ~~~~.)  
0	Where does this come from?
0	:One page could easily accommodate all episodes.  A whole page for this stuff is ridiculous.  The guides are poorly written and edited by the way; someone will have to come in and correct typos, etc.  Also, the episodes should be numbered, like other television shows.    The user should register and log in, by the way, so we can communicate on his or her talk page instead of individual discussion pages.     
0	`:Further thoughts:  I did a look-up for the Seinfeld show; this show has one page for all episodes.  You can use it for a model.  If a nine-year-running show, the most talked about and watched in history, can accommodate all episodes in one page, then so can The Fairly OddParents.  Remember, this isn't a hobby site for you to collect your private thoughts and feelings on arcane matters.  Some of your ``trivia`` items are really reviews of the show.  This is not in keeping with Wikipedia.  Any opinions about episodes should be deleted.  Follow the Seinfeld model and you'll do well.   Good luck.    `
0	To the person who created this page:Thanks for your work getting this article going!  It sounds like an interesting film.Please note that there is a really easy way to create internal link within Wikipedia  just add two brackets, not one, on either side of the word you want to link.Good luck with future editing.
0	Please avoid turning this article into a promotional piece for the show.
1	your fucking face. faggots
0	:: The project wasn't vandalised.  I simply edited the user list to removed 3 members who were considered bad faith. 
0	:::The second project, Wikipedians against censorship is a cynical trolling campaign lead by Gorgonzilla, a well know problem user.  It would be entirely inappropriate to merge the two.

0	That's funny, TDC violates the 3RR, 10 zillion sock puppets come along to help restore his edits, and what do his edits say?? John Kerry is a commie thank god you didn't jump to any conclusions and ban him or anything 
0	`==Research==In the summary of a, so called ``edit``, by an anonymous user of whom we all know it's , done on the 24th of August 2005 (couple of times) it's written: (This version is the most reliable version according to any facts, and according to any source!!!  All herein is researched. Mario Roering is a twisted insane person and so are his edits!)Besides the fact that he keeps calling me all kinds of names to which I can only comment look in the mirror!, he is talking about some ``research``. Let me tell you here that this alleged research is the research performed by one single man (you guessed: Peter Lee!). I do not know if he really researched it all and is deliberately twisting the truth, but I have done a counter-research, together with a colleague, and came to a whole bunch of different conclusions!!! So far for this by Peter Lee so called ``research`` then...Now, researched or not, this article here is about WGKF, the World Genseiryu Karatedo Federation. Everything written here is their point of view. It is not necessary to start every single sentence with ``according to WGKF...``, since it is already the title of the article, so it must be clear to anybody that this is about them, from them and according to them! Deleting the facts (researched or not) and replacing them with the 'facts' from one single person who claims to have done research, but only brings in HIS point of view, makes the whole article about something that is NOT WGKF, but maybe about Peter Lee, or, just maybe, about GKIF... And of course that is absolutely wrong! That is not what the article is about... Nobody sees people from WGKF changing the story on GKIF, do you??   14:36:29, 2005-08-24 (UTC)`
0	`:Yeah, sorry... Got a little carried away when I saw all the insulting language about me in the other summaries... This guy is really pissing me off sometimes, especially now he is hiding behind all the different ip addresses, in stead of showing what a 'man' he is and use !! BTW, I did write a message on the so-called 'research' on the talk page...   14:46:19, 2005-08-24 (UTC)`
0	Why is PBS used instead of ordinary saline?
0	`==Chicken-Ryu?==All the ip addresses you used so far, for your (sneaky) vandalist actions and keeping the edit war alive:* * * * * * * * * * * * * (This list is probably not even complete!!)In stead of hiding behind all kinds of different ip addresses, you could at least have the guts and the decency to insult me using your own name!?! Or are you chickin'??? Maybe you can change the name of your style (Genseiryu-Butokukai) into Chicken-Ryu??? Wouldn't even be so bad, since your McDojo is after all called ``Kentucky-Kai``!!! -)) At least I am not afraid to use my own name, especially since I know I have nothing to hide and I am on the right side!     P.S.: are you still gonna answer the question above here (Genseiryu-Genseikan)???`
0	`:Thank you! Sometimes I do get a little bit carried away however. Not hard to believe regarding all the insults and name slandering I have to endure from this guy ... But, I will try to work as much as possible in a Wikipedia way and listen to all the advice you and JeremyA gave me...   `
